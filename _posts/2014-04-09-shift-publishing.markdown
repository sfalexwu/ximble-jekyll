In order to make it easier to publish shifts, we have released a new feature that allows you to publish individual shifts. This new update also includes new visual cues for published and unpublished shifts.


One of the first things you will notice is that the shift dialog now has a "publish" button. This allows you to publish just the individual shift

In addition, published and un-published shifts now show a different background. Published shifts show up with a solid colored background while un-published shifts will show a lined background

Note that with this new update, the word "published" will no longer display below the header for each day of the week. Instead you will now see a new label showing the number of published and un-published shifts for the schedule.
