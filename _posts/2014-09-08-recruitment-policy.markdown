We've written a lot, here, about [your employment brand](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employment-brand/) and about making your employees into [broader advocates for your entire business](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-advocates/). But what about branding yourself right from the initial recruitment policy?

That way, even the candidates passing you by get an idea of who and what you are - and you should see better candidates taking more interest.


## What is the Point to Recruitment?


Your entire organization may need to sit up and take notice. It's not just a matter of Human Resources having a finger on the pulse of the job market. On the contrary, recruitment policy is also a matter of actively maintaining your company's presence in the broader jobs market, and in a sense, in the broader marketplace. That's no small potatoes. Here's what your stated policy needs to include:

**1: Maintaining and augmenting an adequate pool of qualified candidates is an ongoing project.**
** 2: Minimizing the cost of interviewing and on-boarding by optimizing the qualifying process for candidates.**
** 3: Retaining employees, once they're onboard, so that you're not continually losing money on recruiting, hiring, orienting and training.**
** 4: Meeting all outside and social obligations**
** 5: Identifying and work with appropriate sources for candidates**
** 6: Reviewing what works and eliminating redundancies**

That's what an active, dynamically driven policy - manned by an engaged team - should be doing.


## These Eight Points are Designed to Get Your Recruitment Team - and your entire organization - back on its feet.


**1. Process are only Processes so long as they are continually being improved.**
Your recruiters need to be continually in tune with the best in the business and continually learning from them. This is more well-known in IT circles but there's no reason it can't give your organization the best darn recruiting process in the world. Always be tweaking. Look at the best practices of other organizations and see what you can change in your own. Don't mess with success, but be honest when an idea falls flat and seek out alternatives paths to the goal.

**2. Talk to Everyone and Anyone - including Candidates
**You know what they want. They know you know. Give them the straight up. If they aren't qualified, tell them how to get qualified. Answer your phone and start talking and make transparency as much a part of your team as it in the rest of the company.

**3. Social is Happening Now**
Don't keep waiting. Social recruiting is all about what's happening right now and it's only going to get better. Employee referrals are among the very best referrals you're going to get. So, even if you're company Facebook page is still embarrassing, it's going to pay to look into getting more out of (almost) all of the places online where your current employees are hanging out.

**4. Build a Means for Staying in Touch.**
Even if you don't have current positions, better people want to know more. Just like your sales teams sells your products and services, your recruitment team needs to maintain relationships, sometimes for the long-lead sale.

**5. Review for Suitability
**Only your managers are going to understand requirements. But managers in constant need of new hires are missing something. Either on the retention side, or on the side of competencies, someone needs to review what's creating the need.

**6. Consistency**
This one seems to often get glossed over, but work with marketing to see that your brand and your message are clear and attractive. Even in the simplest Help Wanted ad, your Brand is out there and it needs to be polished.

**7. Build Networking Into the Policy**
Recruiters tend to be good network-ers. But that's not always true of everyone else in your organization. Do they know when new candidates are sought? Wouldn't they like to? In most cases a sound policy that encourages recruiting will work to your advantage, and lots of folks are more than happy to lend a hand in the recruitment process. But they've got to know where you stand.

**8. Respect**
Branding goes nowhere if you haven't got respect for everyone involved in the process. And respect can mean answering all the right questions, or it can mean working towards complete and open transparency. In every case, you owe it to the candidates, qualified, vetted or disqualified to make the process as open as possible. Respect may require some documentation, but that's there for both sides too.

**Revise away.** The recruitment game is not going to get any easier and it's not going to go away. But in every case, you're stated policy needs to be a dynamic, always ready to revise document that grows as quickly and easily as the group of people working for and with your organization.
