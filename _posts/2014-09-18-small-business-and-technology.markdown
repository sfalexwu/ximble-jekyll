The modern world keeps offering new apps and gadgets that people can use in various ways. What started as a simple way to improve communication between people, especially between those separated by large distances, nowadays takes over our lives and even causes some concerns. Can technology be used in a healthy, productive way? Can technology help you grow your business?

The answer is very simple: **Yes**.

**Monitor your business productivity using technology.** There are a lot of apps and online tools that will help you monitor your employees' performance and business productivity. Set your goals easily and monitor the performance of either one employee or whole departments using tools available. This is where apps like Nimble Schedule come very handy and may help you increase the overall employees' performance as well as track business goals and employee attendance.

**Move your data to the cloud**, and access them easily from anywhere in the world with any tool available. Most of those cloud apps will allow you access using both a web browser and smart phone apps. This is a perfect way of handling your business on the go and an opportunity to supervise your employees' performance or join the internal company messaging system and be involved in daily routines.



**Let those inexpensive online tools help you turn your business into a money making machine.** Pull out reports with a single click of a mouse button and focus more on setting new goals and applying new routines and products. Analyze costs and incomes of your company on a weekly or daily basis and stay ahead of all possible issues.

**Connect your employees virtually and let their business communication flow.** Daily communication and consulting about various issues or opportunities may prove very useful and beneficial. Do not hesitate to connect your employees and departments and provide them with an easy to use channel of communication. This will improve issue handling and may provide improvements in the areas where employee collaboration is a must. Additionally, this will also help employers and managers to stay on top of everything and keep an archive of some internal agreements and communication messages.

**Improve customer and employee scheduling using cloud apps.**  The time has come to ditch all those paper notes and spreadsheets and start using 24/7 accessible cloud info. Let your employees view their schedule anytime they wish, ask their co-workers to replace them or request a time off easily by using their smart phone. Schedule your meetings through the cloud and let your team members view your schedule and help you gather material or provide you with other information.

**Use marketing plug-ins and tools to compete with large industry players.** There are a lot of Gmail plug-ins and various marketing tools coming at very affordable prices that will help you compete with those big companies from your niche. Stay on top of your business contacts, follow leads, deals and sales and much more using free or very affordable online resources. Build your client loyalty by offering various reward tracking programs made easy for small and medium business through the use of specific online tools.

These are just some examples of how you can use technology for your company's benefits and easier monitoring of your costs and sales as well as employees' performance. We haven’t listed the specific names of the tools since every company might need a slightly different feature set so we leave that to you to explore. As nowadays small business and technology go hand in hand, don’t hesitate to use online and cloud resources whenever possible to take your company to the road of success.
