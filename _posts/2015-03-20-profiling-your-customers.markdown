One of the most important steps in running a successful business is knowing your customers. Who are they? Why do they shop your products or subscribe for your services? What are those things about your company that clients recognize as your advantage when compared to your competitors?

Depending on the type of your business, there are different pieces of information that could be useful to know about your clients. For example, if your clients are other companies, then perhaps you should know their niche industry, the number of employees and similar details. If your clients are individuals, then other type of information may be useful, like their age, income, gender, spending habits, etc.

### Gathering information



There is certainly more than one way of gathering such information. One approach, in case you run a store, would be to simply assign a task to one or two of your employees to monitor obvious information like your shoppers' age or gender and collect that info over the course of a couple of days or weeks. 

Another approach would be to randomly pick some of your clients and ask them to complete an anonymous survey, either while shopping at your store, or by filling out an online form providing that you run an online business. 

Once you have collected information, try to create a database of your clients’ profiles which would be browsable by different parameters. Organizing your current clients by age, niche industry or any other parameter would make it easier for you to target them with some new product or upgraded service. Storing this particular kind of information is an important step, so always take serious actions to protect your clients' personal data.



### The value of collected information



The information you collected about your current clients will help you better understand why they shop or subscribe with you. It should help you understand why those clients chose you as opposed to your competitors and recognize the key advantages your business offers. 

Namely, the gathered information about your existing clients may help you target your [marketing campaigns](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/web-marketing/) for gaining more customers in the future. By knowing your targeted age group, or gender, you can make better marketing campaign choices and save a lot of money by making wise decisions and, eventually, you can gain more customers by having such targeted campaigns. 

Furthermore, having such data on your end can help you [point your business to the right direction](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/keep-your-small-business-focused/), the one leading you to  implementing products and services that actually come of interest to your customers’ profile structure. Instead of wasting your time and resources on trying to upgrade your services or bring new products that are of no interest to your [loyal clients](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-build-customer-loyalty/), you should focus your financial and employee efforts towards requested or useful service upgrades or new valuable products.

### Seek ongoing feedback and repeat the process of gathering info on a recurring basis



Collecting information should not be a one-time activity. On the contrary, repeating this process over a longer course of time can correct smaller irregularities and present a clearer picture about your clients both to you and your team. Note that your client base can change over a longer period of time so you should definitely be prepared when that happens.
