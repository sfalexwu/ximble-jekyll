Every person that tried to manage a larger group of employees will confirm that this can be an exhausting and hectic process. No matter how good your organizational skills are, sooner or later some sort of miscommunication between employees may occur. For those few lucky ones, however, that doesn’t happen when struggling to meet a deadline or satisfy an important client.

As with many other aspects, we tried to help here with a couple of useful built-in functionalities. Communication between managers and employees, or among employees  themselves does not have to be so hard anymore. Let us present to you two major features in our workforce optimization system that will make your employee management much easier and less stressful. 



#### Announcements



If you have an important piece of info to broadcast to your employees, or at least to just a few of them, then you will love our Announcements feature. By posting an announcement, you’ll be able to post your message to all your employees, just managers or just employees working at a certain location.

Once your employees login to the system, they’ll be able to read this announcement on their dashboard. Apart from that option, depending on their notification preferences, your employees will also be notified about new announcements via email or SMS.



#### Private messages



Besides posting an announcement, you can also communicate with your employees by sending them direct messages. These direct messages can be sent to a group of employees or just to specific individuals. When sending a message to a group of employees, you can choose whether you wish to send to employees working on a specific position/job role or in a specific department.

As with announcements, these direct messages will be dispatched to your employees via email and/or SMS, depending on their notification preferences. Employees can also reply to those messages and communicate with their managers, or internally if your company decides to allow that option.
