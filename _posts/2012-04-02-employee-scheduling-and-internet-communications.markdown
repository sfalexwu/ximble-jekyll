In the Internet Age, just about everyone believes they already know the secrets to effective, useful and efficient communications. It's a wonder then that so many businesses, large and small and everything in between, are still plagued by miscommunication, communication breakdowns and simple failures. 

In our business that can simply mean employee absences. Excused, in-excused or inexplicable, absences often come down to simple communication failures and those very often concern the where, when and what-time exactly of any job posting. 
Schedules that can involve dozens or even hundreds of employees are often the least understood and the schedules that involve the smallest number of people who really need to be involved in their own creation.

That's always been the case, particularly when a work schedule is drawn up on a single sheet of paper, perhaps copied and posted physically in the hopes that every employee will verify and accept it. That was the top down world of employee scheduling. 
Disgruntled or unhappy workers, even when they're the otherwise best on the team, are told “tough luck” and the schedule stands until it sometimes painfully or pain-stakingly done all over again.

Today, it may be still impossible to keep everyone “happy” all the time. But prioritizing employee communications before, during and after the scheduling process makes a lot more of them a lot more “happy” than ever before in the past. If you're in a competitive industry having trouble holding onto your best employees, or your spending too much time on scheduling, it should make you happy too. 
Simple effective staff communication today requires a robust tool and an internet connection. It really is that simple. And managers are constantly surprised by how effective instant messaging by email or text SMS can be, especially when it is two way communication. 
There's simply no question that employee input and interaction radically increases employee morale and the level of respect they feel for an employer. And the number of excuses for misunderstandings, missed shifts or absences has been known to drop dramatically. 
It really is as easy as deploying an internet based solution that automates communications and calendar schedules so that employees get a front row seat in the decision making process and scheduling managers simply institute some basic rules. Rules can be as complicated or as simple as they need to be.   

Setting minimum or maximum hours are simple ones, but difficult special events or heavy demand hours can be covered and scheduled while under or overstaffing situations are easily avoided. Conflict free schedules can be easily established, reviewed and approved by every employee or just by a shift manager. In every case, miscommunication is minimized and everyone who needs to know gets a notification by email, by SMS text, or by both.
