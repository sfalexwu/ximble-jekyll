Managing employee schedules can sometimes be a tedious and time consuming task especially when [schedule makers](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/) need to manage larger groups of staff members. However, with the advancement of cloud employee scheduling software, some of those issues and concerns have been properly addressed. Besides assisting managers and employers in their daily operations, cloud technology can help employees as well when it comes to absenteeism reduction and cutting down on late arrivals.

In this article, we’ll cover some of NimbleSchedule's features and tools available to both managers and employees, which help them easily monitor late arrivals as well as prevent them.

#### Shift Reminders



With NimbleSchedule, each account comes with a specific set of notifications that can be enabled for each user in the system:

• _“Upcoming Shift Reminder – 24 hours”_ – By enabling this notification on their profiles, employees can choose to be notified via email or SMS about their upcoming shifts, 24 hours ahead of that specific shift.
• _“Upcoming Shift Reminder – 60/90/120 minutes”_ – With this notification, employees can receive an email or an SMS reminder about their upcoming shift. This notification can be set for either 60, 90 or 120 minutes before their shift starts.

Employers and managers can choose to enable these notifications on behalf of their employees to ensure that they are properly notified about created shifts when a schedule is published. Naturally, employees can set any of these two notifications through their personal profiles in the system. These reminders significantly reduce no shows and late arrivals and they save companies significant funds.



#### When employees are late



Unfortunately, sometimes not even notifications can help as some employees tend to come late to their shifts or do not show up at work at all for one reason or the other. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the manager is notified on time so that he could re-schedule some of the available staff members to cover an uncovered position or simply to give a call to the person being late to check up on whether they’re coming to work at all or just running a little bit late.

For such cases, managers have an additional option which they can enable for their personal profiles. The exact notification label/name is _“When my employees are late”_ and managers and administrators can find it under their personal “Notification Preferences” section on their profile. By enabling this option along with either email or SMS, managers can be notified through one of those two methods in case their employee is running late for their shift for at least 5 minutes. This early warning system allows managers to re-act promptly and cover necessary positions in the company.
