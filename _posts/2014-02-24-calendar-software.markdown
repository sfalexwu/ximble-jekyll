_[![Calendar Software](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Calendar-Software.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Calendar-Software.jpg)Calendar software is often the only auto-emailing software that an organization is using. You don't have to be an expert in communications to see that it will do a lot more than tell people to get to work on time.  _

Human resources management teams often include not just the shift scheduling department, but an internal communications department too. Pity is, they [very often don't understand they overlapping their duties and not working together closely enough](http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hr/features/1014675/internal-communications-whose-job-who-shouts-loudest).

If you've installed an automated calendar software program of any kind, to alert employees to available shifts, or even just to their normally scheduled shifts, then here's what else you should understand:


## _Calendar Software Equals Internal Communications Software


That's because it's already emailing your teams.

It's a highly read email and gives you a guaranteed "in" with your audience. **So what are you going to do with it?**

These are eight things people who've automated shift-scheduling with NimbleSchedule Calendar Software are also doing with it.


### 1) Branding


Your people are (or should be) your biggest brand advocates. Use your weekly automated updates to reinforce values and commit to employee well-being. Branding means "what" you are, what your company is, and what it stands for. Branding is nothing less than the full personification of the organization - and that needs to be carefully considered in every message.


### 2) Retention


What does that mean anyway? For starters it means your values are not just an empty statement. They're something behind every thing that your company does. So, your automated messaging needs to be communicating your commitment to those values and how people - all kinds of people - are living up to those values and meeting them.


### 3) Work-Life Balance


It's one of the most important aspects of talent retention - and one of the reasons people get going with an automated calendar system in the first place. So send them a note about how to make the most of their time off, or news about how other team members are spending their free time.


### 4) Recognition


That's right. Not the employee of the month. But the player who did the most with the least, delivered to the customer and exceeded building the company's reputation. Every week can be a great moment to recognize someone. Every week can also be a great moment to nominate someone new for recognition.


### 5) Invite Communications


What could be a bigger headache, right? Well, only if you're really doing it wrong. A well managed operation relies on continual feedback and criticism from all of its players. It's not a loyalty test, it's what **continuous improvement** really looks like.


###  6) Elusive Culture


You can't mandate a cultural change, but you can oversee a liberation, an open and transparent environment that allows you to become a smarter, and way more cost effective operation. _Stalinism_ is very, very expensive. Keeping tabs on people (something NimbleSchedule makes easy) comes at a cost, though. The cost is, you've got to give up a lot of the old ways of doing things and put more trust in your already smart people.


### 7) Extras


**Just like with the email marketing that your marketing team is hopefully trying to improve, internal communications is not ultimately about what you want, but about what your reader wants.** We work with a call center whose employees want to know more about the day care center next door (where the kids of the workers are all staying during the day). The internal communications team works with the day care center marketing staff to deliver news about the center, about childcare and education. You bet those emails get opened.


### 8) Introductions


We also work with a hospital that is simply too big for everyone to know everyone else. Now, not everybody needs to know everybody else, but you bet it helps if the heads of many of the key players in many of the different departments can occasionally show up in your email. A simple link to your internal communications blog works wonders and everyone still gets to their shift on time.

What are you doing differently with your calendar software? Innovation is the name of the game, and we'd love to hear what else can be done with the world's most useful automated emails! Please let us know in the discussion box below.
