## 5 Reasons cloud workforce management has taken off.




## If you're on the sidelines, you may very well be wondering why.




**It's not just a fad or a passing phase,** but cloud-based workforce management tools and solutions are increasinglyÂ separating competitive enterprises from their landlocked former competitors. It should give you pause for thought.




Today everything from data backups to proprietary systems are being uploaded to offsite servers and staying there.




Infrastructure, software, networks and platforms are all delivered through the cloud.




Let's take a look at why it's so important to your own competitive edge.





### 




### 1. Cost Effectiveness




Making any argument for an infrastructure or network upgrade just got a lot easier. The far more reasonable costs of cloud deployments nearly always bolster the argument for making the now much more moderate investment. While an onsite deployment used to command significant upfront investment, today's cloud managers can improve the service they're delivering eliminate or reduce reliance on on-site hardware and related maintenance and contingency systems.





### 




### 2. Maintenance & Stability




Network and supporting applications for standard businesses processes all come to a stop when your server goes down or needs maintenance. In the past 20 years, many work places have gotten so used to downtime that they simply schedule it. Cloud-based solutions operate on a scale big enough that the inconvenience of system or server upgrades almost never affects users. Cloud based systems are far more stable. The latest version of almost anything is almost always instantly available.





### 




### 3. Virtual Everything




This one is really not just a buzzword. Call centers and help desks and entire administrative teams now work, and provide service and support through the cloud and around the clock. A consist real time infrastructure that's always up to date makes it all possible and, again, cost effective. Forecasting, scheduling, and implementation and delivery are all made more accurate and more reliable.





### 




### 4. Ease of Use




The cloud itself would never have taken off if it weren't ultimately easy to learn and easy to use. Demonstrating your ROI just wouldn't happen with an expensive retraining or learning curve. Cloud-based solutions are adopted quickly and usually require no more than an online help file and an FAQ.





### 




### 5. Roll Out & Delivery




**Implementation used to be the most painful part of any demanding software project.**




Delays couldn't be avoided and roll-out was done in stages just to learn how to do the roll out. Those days are over. Cloud based solutions usually just require the creation of an account, or at its most painful, multiple accounts. Solutions are rolled out in weeks or just days and sometimes in a single afternoon.




**Cloud workforce management solutions** are already as close as your G-mail account. Many of your employees are probably already using Google's Drive to share documents or Google Calendar to plan meetings. That's part of the reason that implementing a cloud workforce solution is easy; it's already happening.




Adopting cloud-based technology solutions will continue for these reasons and more.




**You're job is not only to understand why, but to observe how your workforce is already deploying cloud-based solutions and to see how you might take advantage of the opportunity they represent.**
