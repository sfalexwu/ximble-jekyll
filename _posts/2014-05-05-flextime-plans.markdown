## Solid Reasoning for Flextime Plans


Sometimes business management is all over the place.

[Employee engagement is everywhere.](http://www.hrzone.com/hr-glossary/employee-engagement-definition) And so is team building, leadership and various schemes to leverage values, mission statements and creative, continuous improvements.

It all makes sense. It all makes perfect sense to someone who realizes that employees want to be treated like, uh, people.

But business is also tough. Employees, workers, team players - even ducks if you happen to employ them - need to put in solid hours. Often they need to put in a LOT OF HOURS to get everything done that needs getting done.

Being human, living like people, just managing the day-to-day stuff can be a real hassle when you're chained to a desk. And that's why flextime is such an important part of having, holding and keeping the best people in your field.

Any call-center manager will tell you, they regularly watch their best people walking out the door. The walking of skilled workers [costs US businesses an estimated 150% of their total remuneration package. ](http://claritybusiness.ca/employee-turnover-and-the-real-costs/)

Yet even a simply flextime plan cuts way into that cost. It keeps your people happy. It let's them go to the doctor, or the gym or to their other business interests and makes everyone in your organization happy. But that's just the first and most obvious of our five reasons to set up and implement your plan. Let's look at the others in some detail.



	
  1. **Work Life Balance – **Anyone with kids should be able to understand this one, almost too easily. Your employees just don't have time to look after their kids or their parents or their families. There was never a time when a factory policy for in and out time was a good idea. At no point in the past was it ever a working behavioral model. So get rid of the old model and see how your team responds.

	
  2. **Work-Load Sharing** – Not just for your employees, but your entire organization works smarter by splitting big, tedious or demanding jobs up among more than one person. You prevent burn-out, force collaboration and avoid over-dependence on one person.

	
  3. **Better Engagement Rates –** Of course we still think about engagement. But you can't really expect employees whose lives are coming apart at the seams to engage with what you've got on offer. More work, the same dull hours and the need to schedule a half hour off up to a week in advance. That's more like a recipe for turnovers than a ticket to success. Employees with well-managed flextime alternatives not only think twice about quitting, but often deeply appreciate the unique opportunity an employer provides.

	
  4. **Better Coordination –** Alternate schedules insist on employee self-coordination - just like the scheduling itself. When teams are collaborating on hours, they're collaborating on everything else they're working on, too. Again, that can lead to a smarter organization and a decentralized decision making process.

	
  5. **Smarter Workweeks –** That newly free Friday - or whatever day - can mean management or team leaders get better time for revision, review and planning. If teams are delivering as a result of ten hour days, or compressed work schedules maybe they're enjoying an extra day off. But your real superstars are also enjoying the benefits of working with that compressed schedule - instead of responding to artificially imposed workday stoppages or interruptions.


We've worked with roll out and using all kinds of Flextime plans. With temporary crews, telecommuters and project specific employees. Every possible model has some advantages and can lead to implementation problems. But working with the right plan nearly always has benefits that far outstrip the disadvantages.
