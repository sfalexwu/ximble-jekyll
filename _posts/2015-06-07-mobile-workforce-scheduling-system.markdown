Being a powerful and feature-rich workforce management tool, NimbleSchedule allows managers and their employees to use their smart phones both to create and check schedules. The only thing needed is an Android phone or iPhone.

The procedure is quite simple and straightforward:

Go to the Google Play Store or App Market and look for the term "NimbleSchedule". Once you find our app, install it as you would install any other application on your phone and you are good to go.

You will be required to enter your login information only once. Every next time, the app should log you in automatically.

When you login to the app, the first screen you will see is the schedule view. In case you are an employee and your company restricts employees from viewing everyone’s work schedule, then you will have an option to view your personal schedule as well as open shifts available for pick-up. If you are a manager or an administrator, apart from viewing the work schedule, you will also have an option to create a schedule on the fly by using your phone along with our app. Furthermore, you will also be able to view certain requests submitted by your employees and you’ll have a chance to approve them or to reject them. No more waiting to get to the office, since you can do most of the stuff while traveling to work or waiting for a meeting.

In case you are an employee and your company permits the use of the smart phone apps for time & attendance, then you’ll have a chance to clock in and out by using your phone. The time of having to walk to some dedicated clock post just to clock in or out for your shift has gone. You can do that by using the device you already use every day - your mobile phone.

If you as a manager or administrator allow your employees clock in and out from their smart phones, you will have an additional piece of info on their timesheet entries along with a date, time, note and position. When using a smart phone app for time and attendance, your employees will also leave a GPS stamp when they clock in and out. Therefore, while reviewing your employees' timesheets, you’ll have a chance to see the exact location from which your workforce members clocked in for work. How cool is that?

Stay on top of your scheduling and workforce management needs by using NimbleSchedule smart phone apps for iPhone and Android. Our engineers and developers are working hard on adding even more powerful features to our app, so stay tuned for more info!
