Mentioning [time management techniques and tips](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/time-management-techniques/) to some managers can cause them feel noxious because it usually suggests that they will simply have to cram more stuff into their already busy schedule. With today's continuously developing technology and online tools that are supposed to help us organize our time better and increase our productivity as an ultimate goal, why do we constantly find ourselves overwhelmed with work and rushing to fulfill all our tasks on time?

Although the development of the Internet and technology gives us [tools to help us increase workplace productivity](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/small-business-and-technology/), it also provides many distractions that we should watch out for. Using the tools available in the best possible way is a challenge, but let’s see what the best measures are on how to increase productivity.

• **Do not multitask.** Recent studies show that contrary to a widespread opinion, multitasking actually ruins our productivity. Instead, we should always focus on one task at a time and get it done as soon as possible, so we could move on to the next one.

• **Make a list of your assignments for the day.** If possible, try to make such a list a night before, so once your work day starts, you are ready to start with the work immediately and take on your hardest tasks.

• **Start the day with the most important and hardest tasks.** Take care of your hardest and most important tasks while you are still full of energy and well rested. Once you get those done, you can slowly move to the less important tasks, which can optionally be left for some other day as well in case you are not in a rush.

• **Reward yourself for getting done some of those big tasks.** Think of some small things that please you and reward yourself with them once you get some important task done. It might sound silly, but knowing that there is a small reward at the end might help you speed up a little bit.

• **Schedule yourself for small breaks.** As the day goes by, take a couple of small breaks that will help you refresh your mind and body and get energized for the tasks still waiting for you. Even taking a stroll to the bathroom, washing your face and hands and getting back to your work station will serve the purpose.

• **Eliminate all distractions.** As mentioned earlier, the Internet indeed offers a lot of tools that can help you boost your productivity; however, it offers as many, if not more, distractions as well. So be careful and do not allow yourself to spend half of your day surfing or checking your Facebook or Twitter status.

• **Work from home whenever possible.** Avoiding commuting on a daily basis saves you a lot of time that you would spend in the traffic or preparing for work. If your job allows, try [working from home](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/remote-working/) as much as possible.

• **Organize your work environment.** Whether you work from your company's or home office, keep it well organized at all times. There is no bigger waste of time than having to search through a pile of documents.

• **Avoid having TV turned on while working.** There is a big chance that some interesting TV show will distract your attention from work and you might easily find yourself watching TV for an hour instead of working. Listening to nice and relaxing music in the background while working should be a good choice.

• **Bundle similar tasks.** If you have some similar tasks of less importance, then always  try to batch them up into a single time slot and get them done when you are in the mood for them.

• **Get plenty of sleep and exercise whenever possible.** When having a break, doing a couple of exercises might help you feel much better, instead of just kicking back in your chair or bed and watching TV. A good night sleep may help you feel much better and energized to do the work.

• **Write down important stuff.** Do not just go by thinking “I will remember this”. Always have a piece of paper and a pen close to you during your day and write down all the important stuff. It will help you feel more relaxed knowing that you do not have to bother yourself by constantly reminding yourself about important tasks for later on that day.

These are just some of the steps you can take to increase workplace productivity. We encourage you to think of other [ways that might help you relax](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/unwind-end-day/) during your breaks and after-work hours and energize better for a new day.
