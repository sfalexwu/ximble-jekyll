If you are one of those managers who frequently creates and plans employee shifts, then you are certainly aware of numerous distractions that could easily lure you away from your work. With this idea in mind, our scheduling software engineers developed a so-called “Full Screen Mode” which allows a scheduler to eliminate any visual distractions and work on the schedule in his full (browser) screen.

If you are already a NimbleSchedule subscriber but you haven’t used this useful feature, you can easily find it in the top right corner above the schedule. With the current setup, this feature is displayed on all three schedule views: daily, weekly and monthly.

Once you click on the “Full Screen Mode” option, you’ll notice that the rest of our [schedule maker](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/) will simply disappear and the page view will focus on the schedule part only. This allows you to handle the schedule in a larger overview with nothing on the screen but your employees and the schedule.

On the weekly view, you will notice another very similar option, right next to the “Full Screen Mode”, called the “Quick Edit Mode”. This option gives you almost the same view, but with a slight adjustment for adding new shifts. Instead of displaying a popup for shift creation, you’ll notice that the system provides you with an in-line option to add a new shift. This allows you to enter just a shift time, instead of having to fill in other data and select a position and/or department. In this case, these other details will be selected automatically for you, allowing you to speed up the creation of new shifts for your employees.

Of course, as always, the search box will be included in the view in the top left corner, allowing you to filter out just some specific employees. Once you are happy with the schedule, you can simply click on the “Exit full screen mode” button in the top left corner above the schedule and return to the regular system view with all other features presented. 

If you would like to see more features like this one, please let us know. We’d love to hear from you!
