Thanks to the development of modern technology, remote working is no longer just a theory, it has become a reality. Nowadays a large number of employees work from their homes for the benefits of both themselves and their companies. Depending on the exact industry niche, this may be a more or less spread practice among start-up companies and there are certainly many pros and cons that are to be taken into valuation when thinking about remote work opportunities.

Let's start with highlighting some of the advantages of remote working:

_Pro_: Cost reduction on multiple levels. Paying for offices and other expenses may not be so cheap, especially if your company hires more than just a couple of employees. Add electricity and other bills to that amount, and the sum adds up pretty quickly. By having your employees work from their homes you may need to cover just part of those expenses (like phone bills or different collaboration tools) but you get to save a lot on offices and furniture. On top of that, employees save a lot on commuting as they don't have to travel to their offices every day.

_Pro_: Better time effectiveness. Employees save a lot of time they would usually spend on traveling to and back from work. Furthermore, some people spend a lot of time preparing for going to work. This may consume even up to an hour or more. Working from home saves all this time and employees can use it more efficiently.

_Pro_: Less impact on environment. With less traveling, people make less impact on environment. Environmental pollution caused by human actions should not be ignored. Therefore, anything that we, as a society can do to reduce it should be welcomed. Less commute means less pollution. 

_Pro_: Productivity increases. With less things around you to disturb you, the peace and tranquility of your home provides an excellent surrounding to focus better on your work and increase your productivity. 

_Pro_: Significantly better employee selection. With access to experts and talents from wider areas, or even different countries, you gain access to some niche experts that you probably wouldnâ€™t be able to find in your local area or perhaps it would take you a lot more time to find. By hiring remote workers with right skills, you can even increase the quality of your product or service. 

Here are some of the downsides of working remotely:

_Con_: Harder communication. With employees across different time zones and working hours, the communication between your team members gets harder. With this in mind, companies that do hire employees should invest more in certain online tools that help remote teams share ideas, project details, etc. 

_Con_: Trust issues. Without direct supervision, this method may cause some trust issues between your different team members or between managers, on one side, and employees on the other. Some may argue that team members without direct supervision may also provide a lower work quality, which is not a widely accepted opinion.

_Con_: Social isolation. Without face-to-face interaction with other co-workers, the remote working method may cause social isolation between people working such jobs, which raises some concerns.

Without an attempt to make a definitive conclusion on your behalf, both pros and cons should be taken into consideration when thinking about your specific approach to this topic. Depending on the exact industry niche or other factors, you may  or may not find remote working suitable for you. In any case, as there are countless remote work opportunities why not giving it a try?
