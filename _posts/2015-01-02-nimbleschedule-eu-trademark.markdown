As of December 31, 2014, NimbleSchedule is a protected trademark in all the countries of the European Union. Having protected our intellectual property on the territory of United States and owing to the fact that our software is used globally, this step was our natural progression. 

Over the course of 2014, NimbleSchedule significantly expanded its team. Our customer support, sales, marketing and development departments tripled regarding the number of staff members. On top of that, we had important changes in the company's executive team, which made our company even stronger and positioned us as a leading SaaS company on this niche market.

Due to all the changes made, the number of clients increased sharply. Companies from the United Kingdom, Italy, France and other European countries started trying out our system and subscribing. We are proud to say that we managed to cover business users from various industries and from all over the world and we are looking forward to serving all the clients in need of our refined and elegant workforce management solution.

Following the global market's increased demand for our core product, we became aware that protecting our brand and logo is a logical step, the one preventing trademark infringements. Therefore, effective from December 31st, NimbleSchedule's name and its logo (in a couple of different versions) are now protected trademarks in all the countries of the European Union.
