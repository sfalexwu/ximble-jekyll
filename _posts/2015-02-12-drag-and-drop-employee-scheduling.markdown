In the software world there is always a procedure to get certain tasks done. That procedure usually includes a series of actions that consist of a lot of clicks across various screens, pages or options. The situation is the same in the cloud software world, especially when it comes to workforce solutions. If you are in charge of making employee schedules, then you are probably already aware of the longevity and complexity of such a process.

Our engineers and UI experts recognized a need to build useful shortcuts for the scheduling process that would save you time and get the work done with less stress. One of them is certainly the drag-and-drop feature which has shown excellent results. What used to be a tedious and time-consuming task can now be done in seconds. Namely, the only thing you need to do is simply pick up a shift with your mouse and drag it to a proper schedule slot. How cool is that?

[![Scheduler Drag-and-Drop](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scheduler-Drag-And-Drop-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scheduler-Drag-And-Drop.jpg)Reorganizing parts of the shifts on the schedule now takes significantly less time with this option. Instead of wasting a lot of time on clicking on a specific shift, waiting for an edit dialog to show up and then erasing the name of an existing employee assigned to that shift and selecting a different employee, now you can just simply click on a shift, and drag it wherever you want. You can drag it across different days or different employees - the choice is yours.

As always, the employee to whom you wish to re-assign a shift needs to have the proper position/skill on his/her profile. If that condition is met, then there is nothing else you need to worry about. On the other hand, if you are simply moving a shift for the same employee from one day in a week to another, then that’s even easier. You just click on the shift with your mouse and you drag it into the slot for another day where you can “drop” it. As soon as you perform these actions, the employee that gets assigned to the shift receives a notification that a new shift has been added to his schedule. Similarly, the employee whose shift has been removed and allocated to someone else receives a notification about the removed shift as well.
