One of the biggest advantages of cloud systems is an option to integrate with other cloud systems in order to make business management a lot easier and to cover more aspects. That's why our development team is constantly working on new integrations and options regardless of if those integrations are built with full or semi automation. Our latest addition of 3rd party systems with which our software can communicate, at least in a semi-automated manner, is Paychex Preview. 

In order to allow our clients who use Paychex Preview to easily sync their payroll data, our development team has built a new file export feature. From now on, all clients using this payroll system will be able to configure the system easily and export the payroll report file in the format that’s automatically accepted by Paychex Preview and handle their payroll execution within minutes.

In order to configure this new feature in our system, please navigate to the Payroll Settings section and from there, select the “Paychex Preview” feature from the drop down. Once you do that, you’ll get a list of fields for parameters that you can obtain from Paychex. You’ll be asked to enter your company code with Paychex Preview, as well as your hourly codes for regular hours, overtime hours, double time hours and special hour code. You can also select an option to include the earned total amount for each shift in the export file. If you already have a pay-rate properly set through Paychex Preview system for all your employees, then you can just disable the amount calculation for the payroll export file since the system will automatically calculate the amount based on the pay-rate setting.

Once you have the settings section covered, you will no longer have to worry about that step. All you need to do is to run your payroll report as you would in our system, and in the top right corner you’ll notice a new button with the label “Export to Paychex Preview”. Once you click on it, the system will generate a textual file with all your data. You just need to ensure one thing before you proceed with this export: all your employees need to have their employee id configured on their profiles.

On the screenshot above, you can see how that export file may look like, with a different data, of course. If everything looks alright when you export your file, you can proceed to import it into your Paychex Preview system. This allows you to easily complete your payroll processing for all your employees in a matter of minutes.
