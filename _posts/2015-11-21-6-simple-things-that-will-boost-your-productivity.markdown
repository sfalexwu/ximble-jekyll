If you’re a busy person, then one of your main challenges is probably how to get more time to finish certain tasks and projects or, alternatively, how to boost your productivity in order to get more stuff done in less time. That's why we've prepared a list of some fairly simple things that you can start implementing straightaway, which will eventually lead to increased productivity at your workplace.

#### 1. Merge similar tasks into a single batch


If you have to complete a group of similar tasks during the day, like making a set of calls, writing emails or anything similar, it may be a great idea to bundle all the tasks into a single batch and complete them all at once. Instead of procrastinating, you should try to finish them one by one in a row, while your mind is set to a working mode and get everything done as soon as possible so that you could re-focus your attention to something else.



#### 2. Divide large tasks into smaller chunks


Sometimes you probably hesitate to start working on some very large or difficult task because you know in advance that it will take you a ton of time and you may not even finish it in a day. A good idea would be to divide such tasks into smaller chunks and focus on getting such chunks out of your daily to-do list. If needed, you can delegate certain parts to your employees or colleagues thus saving your time for other, more important, aspects of your daily duties.



#### 3. Resolve small tasks right away


This technique is also known as the “2-minute rule”. If it would take you less than 2 minutes to complete a certain task, complete it immediately and do not leave it for later. Force yourself to take action straightaway because the sheer effort of memorizing or writing down a task may sometimes take you much more time than completing it in the first place.



#### 4. Track how you spend your time


Sometimes you have a feeling that time just flies by when you sit down to work and you do not even remember why it took you so long to finish something you thought it would take much less time. If this happens more often than you would like, it may be a great idea for you to start using some smart phone apps or computer software that will help you keep tracking your time. That way you can refer to your log and see what went wrong and why it took you so much time to complete a certain task.



#### 5. Stay away from distractions


Many people say that music being played softly in the background makes their work day better and keeps them better engaged rather than working in silence. There are, however, those who claim that such a working atmosphere leads to a significant waste of time and concentration especially when a set of their “favorite” songs starts playing and they start singing along. The same can be said for some other distractions like chit chatting with colleagues throughout the whole day, surfing the web or using social media websites. Therefore, if you notice any of these things start taking too much of your time or you become distracted, simply shut them off while working and allow yourself some of those “treats” during your breaks.



#### 6. Learn to say “no”


Sometimes your colleagues might come to you and ask for a favor which would include disrupting  your schedule and moving your focus from completing important business tasks to some trivial things. In such cases, the best idea would be to politely say “No” and keep your focus and energy on things and tasks that you need to complete during your working hours.
