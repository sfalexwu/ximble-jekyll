In the age of technology it would be a pity if an employee still had to pick up the phone and call 5 or 10 co-workers to ask them to replace him on the shift or trade two shifts in case of an emergency or anything similar. Apart from being a waste of time, this process quite often puts a person in an unpleasant position where he needs to call colleagues one by one and ask them to trade shifts. With the rise of popularity of cloud scheduling tools that problem is now resolved.

If you are already a NimbleSchedule user, then you are probably familiar with functionalities it offers.  On the other hand, the level of customization in our workforce management system frequently offers some functionalities under the hood that you perhaps haven’t discovered yet. By adjusting the settings section, you can instruct the system to either automatically allow shift trading among your employees, as long as both sides agree to trade shifts or make that process a bit more formal and set the system to require an administrator’s or manager’s approval at the end of that process.

Requesting to trade shift with another employee is an easy thing to do from an employee’s point of view. While viewing the shift, an employee can request to trade each of those shifts for another employee’s shift, which will be automatically listed by the system. Furthermore, if needed, the system administrator can configure the system to even allow shift trades among employees working in different positions. Although this is not such a frequently used option, we’re sure you’ll appreciate that there is such an option built-in in case you need it. By default, the system will allow shift swaps among employees working in the same department on the same position. Plain and simple.

Your employees prefer to use smart phone apps instead of web panel? No problem. By using their Android phone or iPhone, your employees can check their schedule and request to trade shifts from their phone, at any time, from any place. Just by clicking on a specific shift and then selecting an option to trade that specific shift, your employee can now request to trade a shift from his car, a restaurant or any other place. How cool is that?

Stay Nimble!
