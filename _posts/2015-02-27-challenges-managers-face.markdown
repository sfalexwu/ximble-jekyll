Being a manager has its advantages but it has also many day-to-day challenges that good and efficient managers need to overcome. Some of those managers’ challenges relate to daily operations, while others have deeper roots in the human nature and interpersonal relationships. With an idea to point out some of those challenges, our goal is also to help out those who experience certain challenging situations in their everyday activities so they could overcome such challenges in the best and easiest possible way.

1) **Getting your team motivated.** This is probably one of the most important challenges every manager faces on a daily basis. Managing a highly motivated team to perform best at their duties is a must. Yet, it is easier said than done. With every day manager responsibilities and issues in personal lives, it is hard to keep the team spirit high at all times. Knowing your team members well is key for success here. With a clear vision on what motivates each of your employees and how to get them up and running is valuable information that every good manager should be aware of.

2) **Coaching and mentoring your team.** It is easy to get lost in everyday manager responsibilities and duties and one can fail to pay enough attention to the team needs. Yet, as a team leader, it is the manager’s duty to coach the team properly and mentor them on every step of the process. Finding some free time on a recurring basis to dedicate to each team member is an important aspect of the successful team management.

3) **Keeping up with the industry trends and technology.** It is important that the manager stays in the loop with the latest industry and technology trends. The manager is the team leader and should never allow himself to fall behind the trends and activities on the market. This does not necessarily mean that the manager should be an expert in all aspects of his business; however, some general overall knowledge of such trends is more than desirable. 

4) **Rewarding productive employees for their good results and hard work.** The process of rewarding your best employees does not necessarily need to include money and bonuses. A well put circular email sent to your employees, clearly mentioning the best ones on the current project should suffice. Similarly, pointing out the employees with the best results on the next company’s meeting would do as well.

5) **Balancing between all sides in the company.** Too many managers make a mistake of being too close with all employees by trying to show themselves as “one of the team”. Yet, by doing so, they sometimes lose part of the influence on some of the team members, and risk being perceived as non-manager’s material by higher company executives. On the other hand, by becoming too close with the executives or company owners, managers risk being perceived as a not-care-enough-for-employees type of  leaders.

These are just some of most common managers' challenges, the ones they experience on a daily basis while trying to pull the maximum out of their team.
