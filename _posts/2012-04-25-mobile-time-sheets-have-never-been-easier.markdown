**Punching the time clock used to require that hourly employees show up and punch in from a regular mechanical clock actually mounted to your wall.**

The result of course was punched cards, time-sheet coordination and ultimately, lots more paperwork.

NimbleSchedule's automated times, and remote clocking in and out process has eliminated all of the need for physical check-ins and outs, and we've made the whole process **a lot more efficient**!

    Online Time Sheets Have never been easier to manage!




With NimbleSchedule, employees can simply click on "My Timesheet" and clock in. When the shift is over, they can do the same thing, from the internet or from a smart phone. You can even set up far more flexible schedules that allow employees to clock in only when they're working and only when it's convenient for employees and the company!

    To clock in, simply click here




That's all whether the employee is on site, or working at a remote location. And clocking out, you always get a summary of the time you've put in, or that your team member put in, and the entire shift is summarized on the Time Sheets page!

    Clock Out and get an instant summary of the shift!




Of course, manually approving online time-sheets doesn't have to take up all of your time. Bulk time-sheet approval is easy because you establish the rules up front and the system will reject requests that don't meet your standards. You still get happier team members because they don't need to waste time traveling any more than you need to waste time scheduling.

And your payroll people get much less paper and can even select what they want or need to print out, from simple time reports to more complex analytics for review or analysis.

No matter how many employees your in charge of, and no matter how many locations, NimbleSchedule lets you approve and process multiple schedules and time sheets for entire teams or for individual workers as easily as sending an email. Employees and staff are notified when changes are made, approved or rejected.
