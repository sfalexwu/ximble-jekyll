Whether you are just negotiating the salary for a new job offered to you, or you already have a job and you are thinking about the ways to ask for a raise, some of the salary negotiation tactics mentioned in this article might come very handy. As always, we are not writing an article that is supposed to be a “know-it-all-article” but we are sure that some of the tips you will read here will be very useful should you find yourself in the above-mentioned situations.

Research your work value. Before even starting a salary raise negotiation, be aware of your work value upfront by researching the topic on time. Have in mind that your work value is not the same category as your personal value. Be reasonable when assessing your professional value and think of an ideal salary you would like to have. Also, think about the minimum wage you would work for and have both figures prepared.

Deal with your fears and all self-esteem issues. Do not let the fear factor hold you down from a salary raise negotiation with your future or current employer. Just because you are afraid of hearing “_No_” as an answer, remember that you might hear “_Yes_” as well. Do not just expect that your boss or manager will worry about this kind of stuff so be prepared to politely ask for a raise or a higher pay rate. If you are trying to persuade yourself that you might not be worth of a higher salary or that you have already been offered with enough, then think those things through. Do not let your self-esteem issues hold you back and do not put yourself down. If you believe that your professional level is higher than what you are paid for, then step up for yourself and state the facts.

Do not let your bad experience from the past control your future. If you were already in a similar situation in the past, and heard “_No_” to such a request too many times, do not let that bad experience affect your future. Be aware of your value, forget the past, and go for it! If you do not ask, you will never hear a “_Yes_”.

Be prepared to make a counteroffer. If your (future) manager makes the offer first, be prepared to make a counter offer in case the offered salary does not satisfy you. This is why it’s important to do some research first and get acquainted with the industry pay rates and rates of your colleagues. 

If you are the first stating the figure, go slightly higher than expected. The expert opinions do not match on this topic. While some claim that it’s the best option to be the first one putting out the figure on the table and that all negotiations will revolve around that first figure later on, others think that it’s much better to let your employer state the offer first. However, if you are the first one putting the figure out there, make sure your initial proposal is slightly higher than the figure you would be happy with. This gives you room to negotiate a little bit and show flexibility on your side. 

Do not take things personally. That’s one of the worst things you could do. Remember that business is business, and that you are not negotiating your personal value. Keep in mind that even if you hear “_No_” as an answer, there might be a reason behind it of which you are currently not aware. With today’s economy it would not be a surprise if some companies are struggling to survive, so keep those things in mind. This is why it is important to think about the rock bottom salary for which you would be prepared to work. When the economy and the business starts picking up, there will be more chances to re-negotiate.

Practice before the actual conversation. If you are the type of person that easily gets embarrassed or starts caving under pressure, then make sure you rehearse your conversation well before the actual salary raise negotiation. Get prepared, stand in front of your mirror and practice all the possible scenarios and outcomes. What will you say and how will you behave if you hear a simple “_No_”? What if you hear “_Not right now, but we’ll see in the future_”? How about “_No way_”? And lastly, but most importantly, how will you react and feel if you hear a “_Yes_”?
