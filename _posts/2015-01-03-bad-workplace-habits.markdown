People spend a lot of time at their work so it is very important for them to reduce their bad workplace habits to a minimum. Besides irritating colleagues and managers, one might prevent oneself from a possible promotion or better success in one's career.

In most cases people are not even aware of their bad workplace habits. So for starters, recognizing your bad habits at your work is a crucial step in improving yourself as a colleague as well as raising your productivity and work related success. A good start would be to keep a journal of your work productivity and assignments during the day and make a note of everything you do. Later on you can analyze your results and see what kind of distractions are the ones causing you to fail to meet certain deadlines or achieve a better productivity rate.

Do you frequently find yourself procrastinating and then rushing to complete tasks? If so, then finding a cause for such a behavior or eliminating all sorts of distractions might help you organize your work life better and achieve better results. Even if you do manage to meet your work related deadlines, rushing to complete your work at the last minute must have certain impacts on the quality of your work. It can also put a great pressure on other team members and colleagues working with you on certain projects.

Frequent grumbling about various things at your work can also cause some negative effects. Aside from bringing a negative tone to your work environment, it also creates a bad working atmosphere for other workers. Hence, trying to find some positive sides even in things or co-workers that you might not particularly like might set a better mood for everyone to do their job better.

Can you [accept constructive criticism](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-give-and-receive-criticism/) in the same way as you can hand it out to others? There’s nothing worse than having colleagues or employees who can’t take a constructive critique as something positive and try to learn and improve from it. Instead, they immediately start arguing and defending their actions, which essentially prevents them from making a better progress in their career.

Do you find yourself frequently proposing someone else to do the task assigned to you because you think they’ll be a better fit? Although it is quite normal to delegate certain tasks to others from time to time, there’s a big difference between avoiding work and delegating tasks. Unless you are a manager, avoid delegating tasks to others as much as possible. It can cause some frustrations on your colleagues’ ends.

Usually there is more than one way to say things. If you are not completely happy with someone else’s work or results, think twice before expressing yourself. Find the best way to say certain things, and think through your wording before actually saying those words. Sometimes it might be much better to say “This is a good start, there are just some things I would change” instead of the plain old “This is not good. Please do your work again”.

Constantly running late for meetings can cause bad side effects. Besides being a completely bad workplace behavior, you can create a chain reaction both for yourself and others especially if you are already scheduled for that particular work day. Respecting your peers time is usually perceived as a good habit whereas the opposite behavior is considered a bad one and has a negative impact on multiple levels.

The last, but not the least is work enthusiasm. People love being surrounded by enthusiastic colleagues, which inspires them to be better at their work as well. 

The list of bad workplace habits doesn't finish there - there are a lot of other things we could mention in this article; yet, these would be some of the key pain points. Remember to practice good habits on a daily basis and make a routine of certain things. By doing so, and by minimizing the effect of bad habits you will set yourself to a path of career success.
