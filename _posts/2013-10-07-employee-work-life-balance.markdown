## Six Management Tips for Actually Achieving Employee Work Life Balance in this Lifetime!


_

Employee Work Life Balance is big issue for any company struggling to keep a big group of people productive and happy.

Yet it's not just a work benefit and it's not just a personal goal - something your employees do on the yoga mat. Building productivity for the long run is something every workplace needs to consider, and consider deeply. These six employee work life balance points are designed to get your workforce happy, adjusted and continually maintaining the balance that's best for all of you.

Work on these employee work life balance points with your team leaders and have them worked on down to the least valuable employees. They'll see the difference - and you will too.


### 1) Set Goals


[If you read this blog regularly, you'll know that we talk about goals a lot.](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-satisfaction/) Your team leaders should be working with employees to understand the goals that they have determined themselves, and those can very well include personal - and outside of the office - goals too. Limits, achievements and dreams are all fair game.


### 2) Establish Rewards


Understanding goals also means achieving them, and extra reasons for doing so. Work with your teams so that rewards are understood, established and fairly administered. And remember, [flex-time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_time) and paid time off cost you virtually nothing.


### 3) Manage Time Wisely


Obviously, we're all about good time management. Talk to your team leaders about better managing their own time, and taking better account of workers' time. Make sure that time requirements and time-off notice restrictions are clearly posted and all of the available software that's designed just for the task is being used.


### 4) Make it Personal


**Your employees want to be treated like adults** - especially the good ones. Freedom comes with responsibility, but your star performers are worth the risk. Make sure they understand consequences, and risks too. But letting them go now - letting them auto-manage and auto-decide and auto-progress -  has all kinds of ways of paying you back. So does understanding, talking about it, and talking about it with all your people.


### 5) Train where necessary


Again, we mentioned in our post on Employee Satisfaction that you need to be prepared for training. Achieving work life balance for your entire team, or your entire company, can take some serious re-allocation of resources.** Stress management can be vital if it turns into a big project, but what employee is going to not love their company after that?**


### 6) Radiate Positivity


**Loving life and your job still starts with you.** Somehow, we think you're up to the task.

But don't underestimate the key criticisms and complaints of your key players. Listen carefully and improve everything you can for each of them. Celebrate their time off the way that they do, maybe not in the off hours, but when they get back. Everything that contributes to their well-being also contributes to the well being of the organization as a whole.

Remember, you can also highlight the positive roles played in and around your workplace. Sometimes the dark clouds come up with the most insightful and brightest workplace tips. Pay attention to them.

**Some of these are long time propositions - and they may take some time.** Workplace culture does sometimes meet stiff resistance, sometimes. You may be pleasantly surprised how quickly and efficiently people take to balance - and learn to love it.
