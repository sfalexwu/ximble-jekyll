If you have recently started using NimbleSchedule, you have probably noticed already how easy and effective our time management software is. Within just a couple of minutes you can:



	
  1. add your employees to the system

	
  2. create a schedule

	
  3. run your first reports


Since our employee management tool also has time attendance components, your employees will need to access the system, as well.

Besides their profile management, where they can configure their basic info, set specific notification preferences for the scheduling component or configure their availability, your employees can also swap shifts, request time off, communicate internally between themselves or with the management and many other useful things. Hence, they need to be granted access to the system.


<blockquote>_**Once you have added all your employees to our time clocking SaaS system or you have synchronized their profiles and info from a third party system, you can distribute their account information to them and invite them to start using the software. No matter if you wish to invite all employees from your account or just a certain group, the procedure is very simple.**_</blockquote>

_**If you want to invite everyone from your account, ****_click _on the “Invite” option above the employees’ list and from the small drop down menu select “All Employees”.**_

As soon as you click on that option, an automated email with the necessary information will be sent out to all employees.

_**On the other hand, if you want to invite just a couple of employees first to take a crack at the system, or perhaps just your managers and schedulers, you can select those specific employees from the list, click on the “Invite” option above the list and then on the “Selected Employees” button.**_

Immediately upon clicking that option, the selected group of users will receive an email with the necessary info to access their NimbleSchedule accounts.

The invitation email will contain a secure link where each of your employees can set his/her own password. This email message will also contain their username, so your employees will have all the necessary information to start using the system. Once they set the password, they will be ready to login and explore our system.

Stay Nimble!
