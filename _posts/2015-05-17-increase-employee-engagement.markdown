NimbleSchedule actively involves all your employees in the scheduling process and improves employee relations. By providing your employees with access to our [workforce management](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/) system, you can allow them to perform certain tasks thus saving you time and money.

### Shift trades



Our modern cloud platform allows your employees to trade shifts with each other without your involvement. Optionally, you can choose whether or not you want your managers and supervisors to have the final saying about those shift trades at the end of the process. By default, all such trade requests will come to the manager for the final approval once two employees agree on swapping their shifts. Of course, only employees with proper positions on their profiles will be able to swap such scheduled shifts.



### Shift replacements



Through our system you can allow your employees to find coverage for the whole or just part of their shift. In case you generally allow your employees to find replacements, they will be able to select one of the available employees with the right position on their profile and ask them to cover for either just one part of their shift or a whole scheduled slot. Once the other side approves that shift replacement request, the manager will be notified about it and he will have the final word about that request. 



### Shift drops



When an employee is not able to work on a specific day or cover a specific shift, he can submit a shift drop request that comes to the manager for an approval. Once the manager or supervisor approves that request,  it goes to the Open Shift area so that other employees with the proper position on their profile could apply and pick it up. Of course, as with all previous options, the shift drop procedure can be enabled or disabled through the settings section, if needed.

Besides those schedule changes, there are other actions you can allow your employees to perform in order to make the scheduling and supervision process easier. You can also allow your employees to submit time-off requests, as well as to set their weekly repeating or one-time availability through the schedule page. All these options make your employees more engaged in the scheduling process which results in saving both time and money on your end as well as for your managers and supervisors. 

Involving your employees in the scheduling and management process improves workplace morale and team communication and it boosts employee motivation.
