The idea of having more options and more flexibility built into the system is always met with approval by our respective clients. With that in mind, we at Nimble Software System Inc are continually working on adding more functionalities thus making our system even more feature-rich with every update.

The challenge we met was that different companies, depending on their organization and scheduling habits, frequently have not only different requests but also completely opposing requests when it comes to a certain part of the system and the way it works. Generally, some managers and administrators simply wish to have more control over what their employees do through the system and over the way certain things are handled. Others, on the other hand, prefer to give more freedom and flexibility to their employees.

To be more precise, when an employee has more than one position assigned on his profile, the question is whether you want to allow him to be able to select one of those positions on his own while clocking out, or not? We had heard reasonable arguments from both sides which is why we decided to go the extra mile and simply satisfy everyone. 

We are thrilled to present you the new “Restrict employees to scheduled position” option in the Time Clocking section of the Settings.

Once you visit the Time Clocking section of the Settings area, you should be able to see this new “Restrict employees to scheduled position” option near the bottom of the page. Enabling this option and saving the setting will restrict your employees with multiple positions from being able to switch their position to any other than the one they were actually scheduled for. 

If you are one of those managers or administrators trying to stay on top of everything your employees do and have more control yet less work while supervising the whole time clocking process, then you will certainly appreciate this new option. It can come extremely handy if you have employees working on multiple positions with different pay rates. Having a better control over the process of position selection in such case is a must if you wish to control all the costs you are due to pay when running the next payroll report. Once you enable this new option, and your employees clock in, the drop down with different positions that used to appear for the clock-out process will be gone.

As you can see on the screenshot above, the drop down menu is gone. Your employee will not be able to change his position during the clock out process and he will be automatically assigned with the position you scheduled him for. On the other hand, if you allow your employees to clock in without even being scheduled, your employees will again have a drop-down selection menu to choose the appropriate position they worked on during that day.

We understand that having more flexibility while creating your rules for the system usage is appreciated. Therefore, we will continue to work on creating other useful features and solutions that will save you both time and money.

What do you think about our new option? Do you find it handy? [We look forward to hearing from you](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/)!
Until then, 

Stay Nimble!
