## **Student Work Shift Scheduling and Flex-Time**




Flexible student shift scheduling has always been important, to the students who make up the workforce or the university staff, and to the full time shift schedulers or managers who need to get a job done. Few of us want a work schedule as complicated as an undergraduate class schedule. But today, it's not only possible but even easy to maintain a staff of part-time student workers with a work schedule that's just as complex as their class schedule.





### **NimbleSchedule Revolutionizes Flex-Time**


Flex-Time implies an advanced, demanding probably professional workforce, maybe with kids in daycare or at school and who just need a lot more time off. That used to be the case.

**NimbleSchedule is pleased to be present the software that makes Flex-Time** **just as easy to manage** for student workers - with ultra complex scheduling needs - as it for shift managers. Whether you're working in a university environment - or in the university itself - you'll likely benefit from the many positive advances NimbleSchedule allows you.

**The Secret is in always up-to-date availability and voluntary shift scheduling.**

**Truly flexible student shift scheduling demands a voluntary approach** that assures student workers really can work when they're available, no matter how demanding the rest of their daytime (or night time) schedule might be. It also means you get happier workers, as many as you need, for the shifts that require them.

A flexible student shift scheduling plan allows your workers to establish and change their availability as often as you and they can agree. Some employers will allow updating preferences as often as every week, while others do it on a semester or seasonal basis.

All you need to do is check an employee's preferences, as above, and either request them for a shift or allow them to fill in their own schedule as they wish. **Notifications by SMS or email are as easy as making changes.** Both employee and manager can set their notification preferences individually, but the automation makes it easy.


## **Flexible Student Shift Scheduling is as easy to Achieve as Using the Software**

Either way, shift workers are much happier.

You can also establish as many rules and regulations regarding minimum or maximum hours, days or weekly standards as you or your business or university department require.
