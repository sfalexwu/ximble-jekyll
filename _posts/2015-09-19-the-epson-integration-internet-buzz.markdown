If you are subscribed to our blog and newsletter, then you are probably already informed about our [strategic partnership with Epson America](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/company-news/epson-strategic-partnership/). Having such a valuable partner is a great honor for us as a company, but more importantly, it is a significant addition to the flexibility and usability of our cloud-based scheduling and time tracking system.

On Wednesday morning, September 16th, the news about this strategic integration of ours has hit the most renowned internet news portals. Websites like CNNMoney, [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/epson-nimble-alliance-idUSnPnb0qHlk+84+PRN20150915), [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/epson-announces-strategic-partnership-nimble-090000748.html) and many others broadcast this great news to their audience. What a treat!

Eventually, more than 250 different news portals released this fantastic news which has reached more than 180 million readers.

Saying that we are just pleased with the level of interest shown regarding our integration with Epson America would be an understatement. Actually, we are thrilled to see the fruits of our hard work and effort publicly affirmed and awarded. 

This is just the beginning for us. NimbleSchedule will continue to grow as new feature enhancements and improvements are continuously being made, which will allow our client base to have an even better friend in our intuitive shift planning and time & attendance software. We thank you all for being a part of our Nimble family.
