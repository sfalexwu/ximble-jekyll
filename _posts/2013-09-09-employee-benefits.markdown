_Employee Benefits come down to practical, useful extras that cement your talent into place and keep them there. These are the ten most important, to all of your employees._


## Employee Benefits are Not Just Expensive Bells and Whistles.


_

**Lots of Principals believe that employee benefits are a big-time expensive headache. **It's a** ** minefield, and every step you take will cost the company tens of thousands more.

But in many cases, old expensive perks sit unused or underused, while much more effective incentives - that show your workers you value them - are practically free and unimaginably easy.


### Employee Benefits: The Ten Essentials




_


**1) Engaged, Informed, Interested Management.** Imagine that. Employees flee whenever and where ever  Management is lousy. We've been to meetings where management could not care less about the company, the policies or the employees. Have you? Anyone directly supervising others needs to have a spectacular personal relationship with all of the employees they plan on retaining. They also need to be engaged and encouraging of the development of everyone under their charge. [If you're management isn't going anywhere](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/), you shouldn't expect your employees to be following along.

**2) Generous easy-to-use healthcare, for their entire family.** We won't go into this one much, because it varies widely from state to state, and Obamacare will change the landscape a lot. Hopefully for the better. This one, anyway, we expect you're probably already on-top of.

**3) Sick Days - with no oversight and no repercussions.** Good employees hate being sick and hate missing work. They also hate management that doesn't openly realize and respect that. Set it up so that your people can call off and still be covered. NimbleSchedule lets [your people cover each other as necessary.](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/communicate-instantly/)

**4)** **Flexible scheduling**. Most of the clients we work with set up flexible scheduling for advanced or senior employees. A few even make it - wisely - into a performance based reward. Reasonable, smart and effective flexible scheduling makes some companies into the magnets for talent that they want to be. But it's only possible because of advanced scheduling software.

**5) A telecommuting option.** Again, within reason, it's a great way to hold onto people, costs next to nothing and keeps your people right where you want them.

**6) Well Defined, Fair Paths to Advancement. **It helps to have roles clearly defined and a good organization chart in place. It also helps if employees feel like they have a fair chance at advancement, and that people aren't advancing for the wrong reasons. Spell it out and base it on rewards and actual accomplishment.

**7) Training and development.** Sometimes we get the idea that training ought to be enforced so that you - management - will learn just how valuable people are. Then you'll take employee retention a lot more seriously. Outside classes and in-house workshops don't have to cost a fortune. Some memberships might be pricey, but they are probably a lot less than re-training star performers who left to get them elsewhere. Bottom line: you can not make unskilled employees care about their performance. You are far better off converting non-skilled workers into skilled employees.

**8) Freedom.** Freedom doesn't have to mean undue risks and costly mistakes. Employees as "owner operators" and who sink or swim based solely on their own abilities is a very efficient way to run your shop.

**9)** **No-Guilt Vacations.** If your people aren't scheduling time off because the pace of work is too heavy and too intense, then you are doing something wrong.  Probably a lot of things. And your facing on-going walkouts and resignations. Make it easy. Make it expected. And make them share what they did or where they went when they get back.

**10) Appreciation.** It can be acknowledgement, it can be announcements in the company newsletter. Unskilled workers couldn't care less. **Skilled workers expect you to see what they researched and studied on their own and applied to your bottom line.** If you can't find it, or you've still got unskilled people jostling over territory, then you can expect more of the same turn-over, bad attitudes and spilled milk.

Don't cry over it. Get your act together.
