NimbleSchedule provides an easy to use, yet powerful scheduling and time clocking system. Over time, we've added a lot of useful reports to our workforce software covering different areas based on the data available in the system.


<blockquote>**Since our shift planning system had been initially designed to track employees' pay rate info and to store scheduled hours for all employees, it was a logical step to develop an easy to interpret overview that would help administrators and managers stay on top of all scheduled costs.**</blockquote>


Once you register with NimbleSchedule and start adding your employees along with their positions and hourly pay rates, all the data needed to calculate your staffing costs will be in our workforce software. If you’d like to have an intuitive insight into staffing costs, you can simply navigate to the Settings section, click on the Schedules option there, and enable the “Show labor cost” option.

As soon as you save that page, two things will happen:

**1)** On the Dashboard page you’ll notice a new chart showing up each time you visit this page. It will show you a global cost of all employees across all locations you have in the system. The chart can be switched between different date ranges, and will show a daily, weekly or monthly cost segments.

Apart from viewing just the number of scheduled hours, you will also be able to view the scheduled cost for each day or simply for the whole week. Since our shift planning system allows location-based scheduling, you will also be able to see the cost for each day, or a full week, for each location by navigating through the location drop down menu in the top right corner of that very page.

There is no need for you to navigate from the schedule page to one of the reports in the system. Neat, huh?
