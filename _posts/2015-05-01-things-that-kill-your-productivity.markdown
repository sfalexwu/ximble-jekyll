<blockquote>**Productivity is of paramount importance no matter what you do for a living**.</blockquote>



In this article, let's focus on some of the things that usually kill productivity. With this knowledge in mind, you can try different approaches to minimize distractions and disruptions and put yourself in the mode of increased productivity.

1) **Distractions** probably deserve to be the first-place winner. With the advancement of technology, there are many websites, tools or apps that just simply kill your productivity or keep it at the minimum rate. 

Social networks are usually identified as one of such “evils” but there are certainly other websites and/or gadgets that could keep your attention occupied for a while instead of having you focused on your work. 

Aside from those techy distractions, there are certainly others, like a noisy and non-productive office environment. Even a noisy co-worker with the station next to yours can sometimes be a major annoyance distracting you from focusing on work; hence, some steps usually need to be taken to ensure a better and more professional working environment. 

2) **Indecisiveness** – another major concern, especially if you are on some hire ranking position in your company. Indecision may lag your work and decrease your productivity rapidly. Making the right decisions on time is an important task that will put you (and your team in case you are a team leader or a company manager) on the right path to conquer the next step of your project or plan.

3) **Multitasking** – contrary to popular belief, it is proven that multitasking decreases productivity and ultimately gets to you complete less stuff. Furthermore, not only does multitasking slow down your work and destroy your productivity but it also decreases the quality of your work since attention to details becomes more blurry when you work on more than one thing at a time. Focusing on getting certain tasks and assignments one at a time may be a much better approach. 

4) **Disorganization** as well as disorder can be major reasons for reduced productivity. Remember to keep your work desk and environment well organized at all times so you can swiftly and easily handle different tasks and assignments. Can you find all files you need in less than a minute? Are all files on your desk properly organized and you know where each document is?

5) **Nitpicking**  could be another major reason for decreased productivity. While attention to details is usually a desirable characteristic, spending too much time on every tiny detail will just simply cause you to waste too much time on minor things. Being a perfectionist is one thing, but wasting too much time on trivial details is completely another. Draw the line between those things.

6) **Exhaustion** including a lack of sleep or too many overtime hours can certainly lead to reduced productivity. It is important to have enough sleep and to be well rested when starting your work day. Skipping a night out here and there before another working day sounds like a good plan. Just an idea!

7) **Bad habits** including unhealthy food, or too much soda may lead your organism to spend too much time and energy on processing all that junk food and too much sugar. Getting rid of all those unhealthy habits, or at least keeping them at the absolute minimum is a smart thing to do, from both work-productivity perspective and your personal health perspective.

8) **Being a “nice guy”** and saying “Yes” to everything is sometimes a certain way to kill your productivity completely. Helping your colleagues is a nice thing to do, but you can’t do it always and interrupt your work and focus while doing some important work. Delaying a response on some of the emails may also create a better working environment for you while keeping your focus on your work. Some things could wait, it’s just up to you to filter the right ones.
