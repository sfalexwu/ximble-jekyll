Due to popular demand coming from our clients, especially from those managing larger teams in medium to large companies, we at NimbleSchedule decided to put some thought in that process and make it easier for administrators of such companies to stay on top of all changes. Hence, some while ago we introduced the Audit Log functionality.

In case your company has a lot of employees and especially a lot of managers and schedulers allowed to make changes to schedule or timesheets, then you will definitely find this functionality very useful. So far, we have covered the scheduling and the time clock/timesheet sections. In case you haven’t noticed these options before, you can find them in both the Schedule and the Time Clock section as the “Audit Log” option in the sub-menu.



### Schedule – Audit Log

As you can see on the screenshot above, this is one of our two currently active Audit Logs. This particular one contains all changes made to the schedule, across all locations. By using the Audit Log section, you will be able to stay on top of all changes made to your employee shifts. No more headaches and complaints that someone changed the schedule and no one knows who did that. Now, your employee scheduling process is an open book.

By using the filter on top of that report, you can additionally refine the search and pull out just those specific records that you need to see. The screenshot below shows what exact events are covered by our schedule Audit Log, and on top of those specific events, you can choose to see only a specific employee or a specific date range. Our schedule Audit Log currently logs all changes made in the last 30 days.

### Time Clock – Audit Log

In the similar manner, our Audit Log simply logs all actions and changes made through the Time Clock section. Every employee clocking in or out, every change to someone’s timesheet record or deletion is now being logged in the Time Clock Audit Log. Each of your managers is now accountable for the changes made to employees’ time clock entries.

As with the schedule section, there’s a Filter menu on top of the Audit Log in the Time Clock section. By clicking on the “Filter” button in the top left corner of the page, you’ll get a choice of filtering out just a specific employee, date range or event.

For the time being, we are covering only these two sections with our detailed Audit logs. We continue to work on the system improvements and hope to have all account related actions and changes covered by future Audit Logs we are planning on adding to the system. These options allow you to manage your company even better and stay on top of all actions and changes made through the system.

If you like these features, please do not hesitate to contact us and tell us your opinion. We’re here for you! In the meantime,

Stay Nimble!
