_Prepare well and go through the list of prospects._ Do not spend too much time on this, but try to obtain some relevant information about your prospects. Any kind of information could come handy here. Write down your findings on the list and try calling people with similar profiles to the ones you already had some success with. This is the part where profiling your prospects in the right way may represent a distinction between success and failure.

_Use a brief, well prepared, sales script._ It is very important to leave a good first impression, because you might not get the second chance. The first couple of seconds are very important, so try to sound polite and confident in what you are saying. Bring up the facts and try to get them interested in your offer. That’s all you might need for that initial contact.

_Focus on the purpose of the call._ All you need to do during that first call is to get your prospect interested in your offer and, without too many details, try to set an appointment or a second call where you could try to sell your product or service. Do not try to make a sale during your first call with the prospect. Your goal should be just to get them interested and to schedule another sales appointment or call where you could actually sell them your product.

_Try to get through to the decision maker._ If the other party agrees to talk, give your best to try to determine whether or not that person is a decision maker in that company or household. If you are out of luck and the person you are talking to is not a decision maker, then do not just simply cut off. They might be able to provide you with an insight on when the actual decision maker would be available for a conversation.

_Be prepared for objections._ Almost every call will include at least one or two objections, so be prepared for them. Try to think of some good reasons and excuses for as many objections as you can and be well prepared when that happens. Don’t waste too much time on explanations, though. Be direct and straight to the point. Address the objection and propose an appointment again through which you could discuss more details.

_Keep a positive and confident tone._ Set a mood from the start and keep it positive. Do not appear as too excited and hyper to the prospect, because people tend to be skeptic towards things that sound too good or too positive to be true. Keep the positive spirit and use an energetic voice. Be confident about your offer and make them believe you are doing them a favor by offering your great product or service.

_Always agree to the appointment time that suits the prospect._ Whatever time they mention for a possible second call or an appointment, agree to it straight away. Once you get their permission to contact them, you will have a chance to re-schedule later on, in case that initial the term doesn’t suit your schedule. 

_Repeat this process as often as possible._ Keep in mind that practice makes perfect, so repeat this process on a daily basis in order to refine the art of cold calling. Be persistent. If possible, try to keep some statistics or reports about previous prospects, which can help you analyze your results and mistakes, regroup and fight for your success.
