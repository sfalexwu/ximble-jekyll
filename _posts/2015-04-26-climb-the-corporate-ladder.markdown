If you have decided to build a career in a medium or large corporation, then you are probably wondering how to get promoted with that many employees around you. Assuming that you are not with that company from day one, then chances are pretty high that the company already has all their management positions filled in with excellent employees. But then, what should you do? How to get noticed by corporate executives and supervisors?

[![Career Advice](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/get-promoted-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/get-promoted.jpg)

**Show initiative from day one**

All supervisors and executives like those employees that show initiative for certain work areas. Of course, you’ll need to draw the line on where initiative ends and where you are actually doing work that should be done only with approval of the manager or supervisor. Hence, be careful not to cross that line for the sake of your reputation, especially if you are a new employee in the company. On the other hand, thinking and working on resolving some of the on-going issues is a good direction. Proposing a solution for some of the problems managers or other employees face in your company is a good way to get some attention from those from the floor “above” and present yourself as a problem solver.

**Be innovative**

As a fresh employee in a corporation where everyone got used to handling problems and issues in a certain way, being innovative could get you some credits. Bringing some new ideas to the table could be that wind in the back that your team needs; therefore, do not hesitate to state your ideas and propose a new approach to solving some of the internal issues or enhancing the company's products or services. 

**Volunteer for new projects**

Volunteering for any new projects that come along the way is another good way to get noticed by your supervisors or company executives. Raising your hand too often could be taken as a sign of being a bit too pushy and trying to work on everything, but do not miss the opportunity to volunteer for projects or tasks where you think your skills could really shine. This will be a great opportunity for you to meet other corporate employees outside your department, leave your office and expand your presence in other divisions as well as learn how your company works.

**Support team members and mentor newcomers**

Being a supportive team player is a must, especially when working in a larger corporation with large teams. This is a habit everyone should exercise so be there for your team members, if not to help them throughout the work day, then at least to show some support when they do something positive. 

When your company expends and hires new team members, showing that you are ready to mentor them and help them get up to speed is a nice way to present yourself as a positive person supporting your company growth. With this kind of a positive attitude toward your co-workers and new team members you could be perceived as an engine of your team that deserves to move up the corporate ladder as soon as the first next opportunity emerges.
