If your company employs between 3 and 3003 staff members, the chances are pretty high that the scheduling process and work time tracking for employees can get quite hectic. And that’s how it has to be, right? Well, not exactly.

With the rapid [advancement of new technologies](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/cloud-technology-revolution/), there’s certainly no reason why your company should fall behind in any way. Working people are nowadays surrounded by computers, smart phones, gadgets and all sorts of devices that could be used to automate significant part of your company’s operations, at least the ones you've had to manage manually until now.

• **Are you an administrator or manager who needs to manage multiple locations?**
You are up for such a great treat with our system! With NimbleSchedule you can easily manage multiple locations and keep your different team schedules separate. If needed, you can assign specific employees to work on multiple locations quite easily, as well. At all times, you’ll be fully aware what kinds of shifts you have, for which positions and on which locations.

• **Are you a manager with staff members across multiple time zones?**
Nothing to worry about, we’ve got your back. With our cloud scheduling platform, each employee can configure his own time-zone on his personal profile and have all shift times automatically converted to the local time. You as the manager, on the other hand, can use your local time to schedule everyone, approve different requests and the system will adjust all time references to your personal time-zone selection.

• **Are you a supervisor that gets a ton of phone calls, notes or emails about shift trades and replacements?**
Our SaaS platform can handle most of those employee requests semi-automatically, asking you for the final approval once your employees already figured what exactly they want to do with their shift, whom to trade with, or whom to ask for a replacement. Once your employee tries to trade a shift, or ask a colleague to replace them on the shift, and the other employee accepts the offer, you’ll receive a notification, which you can approve or reject. The system will save you a lot of time, while at the same time, you'll be in control of all the things going on in the company.

• **Are you an employee who’s tired of having to call 20 colleagues to find a replacement for a shift you cannot work?**
NimbleSchedule allows you to submit various shift requests, such as submitting a drop shift request to your manager, submitting a shift replacement request to all available colleagues in a single click, or submitting a shift trade request by simply selecting a shift you wish to trade for. In case you need to take some time off, you can use our automated system to submit such a request, as well. Has it ever happened to you that your manager approved your request and then totally forgot about it, and you got into a trouble because of that? Well, say good-bye to such cases.



<blockquote>We could continue naming all sorts of benefits that come along when a company decides to use our employee scheduling platform, but that would take a lot of time and space. For now, we’ll keep it brief and we'll keep informing you about other interesting things regarding our system in the following articles. So, stay tuned, NimbleSchedulers!</blockquote>
