Using software that is easily accessible by all your team members whenever you use a company-wide tool is one of the greatest qualities of cloud-based systems. All your employees need is a browser and they are good to go. However, another thing that makes the SaaS industry so popular is the possibility for different product vendors to integrate with each other. Nowadays it is not enough to have a great standalone tool; it needs to interact with other cloud tools in order to make companies using it blossom.

As one of the leaders in the cloud employee scheduling market, NimbleSchedule integrates with a variety of different cloud platforms from the HR, POS and Payroll industries. Here’s a brief overview of all those 3rd party amazing cloud systems that we integrate with.



### BambooHR



BambooHR is an amazing online human resources management platform for small and medium-sized businesses. It allows companies to manage their employee data in an environment that’s much more intuitive and interactive since it allows employees to submit all sorts of requests. The time of keeping your employee info in different Excel spreadsheets is part of the past. 

NimbleSchedule integrates with BambooHR seamlessly and offers many different options when it comes to the data synchronization.

### Gusto (Zenpayroll)



Gusto (formerly known as Zenpayroll) is a widely popular cloud payroll system that offers not just payroll services for hourly employees, salaried staff members and contractors but also tracks sick and vacation time and helps with tracking pre-tax payments and deductions. 

NimbleSchedule’s integration with Gusto is an excellent example of how things should work with cloud platforms.

### QuickBooks Online



Dealing with paperwork is an inevitable part of doing any kind of business no matter how tedious or time consuming the whole process may be. Even if you have an accountant, you’d still want to stay on top of everything by occasionally monitoring your company accounting info, right? With that said, there’s no better way to do that than to use online accounting tools, like QuickBooks Online, used by millions of users, worldwide.

NimbleSchedule’s integration allows the employee data import from QBO into our system. It also offers an easy to use timesheet export tool which allows you to export your employees’ time clock punches from our system into QBO.



### TRAX Payroll



TRAX Payroll is another amazing system with which our employee scheduling platform integrates seamlessly. With TRAX payroll, not only can you manage the whole payroll process for your enterprise but you can also do most of your tax form filling. 

The integration between TRAX Payroll and NimbleSchedule is another great example how software companies should cooperate to make business handling easier and stress free. Read more about it in our [Support section](http://support.nimbleschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/203729336-Trax-Payroll).



### Lightspeed Retail



Lightspeed Retail point-of-sale is an amazing cloud POS system, widely used by small businesses. They offer multi-store inventory tracking with options to access the system via mobile technology as well. Retailers who seek to expend their business to e-world can also leverage Lightspeed’s web store feature which will allow them to move their business, or at least part of it, to the online sphere.

Kounta is a cloud based hospitality point-of-sale platform. Besides POS features, Kounta also offers Table Management, Orders, Modifiers, Inventory Management and Customer Management. To make things better, in cases of an internet outage, Kounta also stores all the data offline so in such cases, it re-syncs with its online platform once the access is regained.

Our integration with Kounta allows you to import your employee profiles into our system automatically. You can also choose to sync your sales data and have comparison between costs and income displayed on our dashboard page.
