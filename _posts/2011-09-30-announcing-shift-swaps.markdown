NimbleSchedule now allows employees to pick up open shifts and swap shifts amongst themselves. All this is done through a very intuitive interface and allows managers to approve or deny the request with one click!

To swap shifts, simply select the "Trade this shift" option on the shift and off you go. You will be presented with a selection of appropriate shifts based on your position and once you select a shift to swap, the receiving employee will be immediately notified of your request to swap shifts. Once they approve, the swap will then take place and the manager can approve or deny the swap if he or she chooses to do so.

To pick up an open shift, simply select "view open shifts" from your schedule. You will then be presented with a list of available open shifts to pick up. After the request to pick up the shift is approved by your manager, it will then show up on your schedule!
