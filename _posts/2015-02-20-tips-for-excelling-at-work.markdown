No matter if your job is in the first, or last place of top 5 important things in your life, having a successful career is for sure one of the most desired goals you want to reach. In case you sometimes struggle with the question of how to increase work productivity, we have prepared some useful tips that might help you excel in your career and do better at your work.

**Assess your work results as objective as possible.** Having a clear idea about your job performance is the first step in excelling at work. [Becoming a workaholic](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/signs-of-a-workaholic/) is probably something that should be avoided. The [right balance in your career and personal life](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/achieving-the-work-life-balance/) is a key for happiness, so achieving the state of equilibrium is a must. Once you have the right amount of time dedicated to your work, [improving productivity](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-productivity/) and being effective is a whole new topic. 

**Act professionally while working.** No matter what type of job you do, acting professionally is something that is expected from you. There is time for fun and jokes, but when the time comes for work, fooling around should stop. Dressing up appropriately for your work environment is part of being a professional as well. 

**Show a positive attitude.** By no means you should be that quiet guy that agrees with everyone and just nods approval to whatever he hears. Demonstrating some professional integrity is a must from time to time. However, when there are work efforts made by others that you disagree with, showing a positive attitude and a good team spirit is even more preferred.

**Be a good team player.** Be aware of your bad temper, in case you have one, and work on toning it down while working in a team. You can be the best employee in the world but if you just keep clashing and arguing with other team members, your contribution to the team might come in jeopardy. Work on your interpersonal skills!

**Do not focus on promotion only.** Even if that’s your ultimate goal, focus on your productivity and results first. Work on your habits and improve your expertise. Working better and harder will ultimately lead to the promotion anyway, but don’t just be that guy in the office that keeps chasing promotions only. Your colleagues will notice that, and will appreciate you less.

**Stand out!** Show yourself as indispensable in your company by the quality of your results and the speed of your work. Don’t just stand out by being the loudest guy in the office. Make your everyday work results speak for themselves. 

**Understand your boss / employer.** Be aware of his goals and work routines. Try to understand him better when he makes a request and analyze his attitude towards your colleagues.  What are those qualities that your employer likes and respects? Could you sometimes anticipate some of the requests coming at your direction from your boss?

**Do not be part of a problem, be part of a solution.** Avoid conflicting situations with other team members even if there is someone annoying you SO much that you just can’t stand working with him. Do not engage into arguing with such people too often, although sometimes you probably need to demonstrate your integrity. Show yourself as part of a solution and money making team for your boss. He will love you for that.

While excelling at work is not all about impressing your employer or getting a promotion, at the end of the day, by excelling at work you will achieve those goals as well. What is probably the most important part of such an achievement is that you will feel better about yourself by constantly learning and striving to be better at what you do.

Remember a famous quote made by Vincent Lombardy: _“The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary”_.
