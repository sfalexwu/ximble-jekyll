Keeping your employees or co-workers well informed and updated about any company's changes is a must in the business world. Therefore, having a right workforce announcements tool could be your major advantage, especially when organizing big events or when dealing with projects on a tight deadline. 

For that specific purpose, our engineers and developers designed more than one way for employee communication. One of those means of communication are instant employee notifications that you can easily post through NimbleSchedule and have your team notified instantaneously.

Once you login to the system, in the bottom right corner you should be able to see the “Post Announcement” label. When you click on it, a small popup window will show allowing you to post an announcement and select a couple of useful options.

Among the first things you’ll notice on this popup window is an option to select the recipients of your announcement. As an administrator, you’ll have an option to post an announcement to everyone, or perhaps restrict it just to a specific location or have it sent just to your managers. These options allow you to filter out specific groups of employees that need to be notified about some important news you have to share with them. In case you select the “locations” option, then you’ll get a list of all your locations so you can select one or multiple locations to post an announcement to.

Furthermore, you’ll have a chance to define an expiration date of your announcement. Having a message sticking out for all your team members is definitely important, but having too many messages posted around could be a bit confusing. Hence, our system allows you to specify an expiration date by which your announcement will be automatically removed.

After you set those initial options, the only thing left is to fill in the message subject and the body of your message. The same thing you would do with an email message, for example.

Once you submit this announcement, depending on your employee and manager notification preferences, they may receive such a notification via email as well, or maybe even via SMS. Of course, if they haven’t enabled any of those two options, they will be able to see your announcement as the first thing upon logging to the system.

This employee communication tool improves team communication and empowers administrators and managers to easily broadcast work related messages to their employees and team members in a heartbeat.
