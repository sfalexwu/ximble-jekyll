The role of HR Management in a company is to hire, train and develop employee staff members and nourish good relations as well as a healthy work environment. A well-developed training process enables employees to achieve better work results, reach their full potential and succeed in winning promotions or excelling at certain areas of a company’s work. Apart from having the hiring and training role, HRM is also in charge of planning the future staffing needs.

In this article we will list some of the most important HR management responsibilities.

**HR Management Responsibilities**

**Recruitment** is one of the primary roles of HR Management in any company. HRM experts usually define job qualifications and experience requirements for new staff members needed for a specific job. According to those predefined criteria, HR managers select the most qualified or experienced applicants and assign them to proper job roles.

**Training** is another important role that HR managers usually assume in companies. Whenever needed, it is usually an HR manager that defines on what kind of training should be assigned to a new employee or staff member in order to better their performance in the organizational setting. Such training sessions are usually designed by HRM and focused on the relevant points from the scope of the job position an individual currently holds.

**Collaboration** is an important factor in every company. It is needed and required on all levels – among employees themselves, managers and/or different teams – in order for them to achieve specific goals or even overall company’s success. The HRM takes care of the healthy and professional relationship on all those levels and makes sure that the company is running in sync at all times.

**Disputes** are, unfortunately, inevitable part of business environments, no matter how well employees cooperate on a daily basis. Conflicts and arguments are to be expected, especially in teams that involve higher number of staff members, and that’s where HR management plays another very important role. It is HRM’s responsibility to mediate between the disputing sides, listen to what each member has to say and define the strategy or recommendation of the ways to overcome such unpleasant situations.

**Commitment** building and enforcing is another aspect usually defined and handled by HRM. Throughout the whole hiring process, HR management is to carefully select candidates with right skills and a proper level of commitment for their new positions. But the story doesn’t stop there. It is an HR manager’s duty to clearly monitor and enforce employees’ commitment to their duties later on, once they assume their role in the company.

**Performance** supervision and appraisals are usually also part of the HR management roles in the company. While their direct/department managers and supervisors monitor the quality of their work, HR managers usually monitor overall performance and coordinate actions with their direct supervisors. This process ensures that employees are on the right path in helping the company achieve its goals, but also on the path of achieving personal goals. HR management can provide advice and, if needed, additional trainings to motivate employees in enhancing certain skills and competencies or helping them achieve certain goals.

**Capacity** building and monitoring is another area where HR management plays an important role. Different firms have different rules and policies regarding rewarding their employees for good performance and advancement of their skills. It is an HR manager’s duty to maintain the pool of talented and hard working employees fresh as they are the most valuable company’s asset that will help it excel in the future.
