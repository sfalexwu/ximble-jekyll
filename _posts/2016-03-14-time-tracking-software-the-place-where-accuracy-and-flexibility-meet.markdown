When a company starts to grow and staff management becomes a challenge, it's of utmost importance to have the right set of tools to help keep that process under control. Having accurate time tracking software that can handle any number of employees’ time clocking entries while at the same time providing access to one or more managers to such data in order for them to be verified and approved is a big deal. The existing cloud time clocks provide either accuracy with very little flexibility, or just flexibility with questionable accuracy and reliability. NimbleSchedule Time Clocking, on the other hand, is a perfect middle where all those needs meet in order to help company owners and managers to stay compliant and track their employees' hours in an accurate and reliable manner.

## Why is NimbleSchedule Time Tracking Software so Flexible?





### Tracking Multiple Pay Rates



With our system, it is quite easy to track multiple positions with different pay rates for each employee. All you need to do to set this up is to assign more than one position to your employees’ profiles, and during the clock-out process, they will be presented with a choice to select one from multiple positions assigned to them. On the other hand, if you’d like to have more control over which position they clock in/out, then you can restrict them to clock in/out for just a scheduled position. By having such flexibility, you can still track multiple pay rate hours for all your employees, while at the same time minimizing any room for potential abuse.



### Easy Verification and Approval Process



Once your employees’ clock in and out, it is important to have simple access to such data in order to verify and approve those hours. Moreover, with our time tracking software, you’ll have a clear vision of who’s currently clocked in and from which time exactly. 

When your employees are done with their shift, you can verify their notes (if they're required to do so), their hours and the position/pay rate they covered for the day. Besides having just one manager approve all such entries, if needed, you can have more than one person approving hours for your employees’ stamps. The approval can be done manually or automatically; namely, our system features a couple of ways to mass approve your employees' hours as well, which makes it really easy to manage your staff hours.



### Time Tracking Through Different Technologies



Many companies sometimes require flexibility when it comes to ways in which their employees can leave time clock punches. Not everyone works in an office or carries a smart phone, although those are quite often the most popular technologies which are used to track employee hours.  With our staff management tool, you can use all of the following methods to track your workforce hours:

• Web panel based time clock
• Smart phone app time tracking
• Tablet/iPad QR Code Time Clock App
• SMS/Text message time tracking
• Phone call-in time clock
• Biometric/Fingerprint device time clock



### Feature Rich Reporting



Based on such time clock data, you can run many different reports in our system and export them via CSV file. Aside from various actionable reports, you can also run payroll reports and either export them to customizable CSV export files or use one of our payroll partnering systems to run the actual payroll through synchronization between NimbleSchedule and many prestigious payroll systems.
