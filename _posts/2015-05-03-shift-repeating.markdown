Being in business for many years, we've had an opportunity to meet and serve a wide variety of people coming from different industries. To our satisfaction, they've all recognized one of the most important values of our workforce management software - IT SAVES TIME. Plain and simple. To push the envelope a bit further, our developers and engineers paid special attention to certain functionalities that should cut down the time needed for automated employee scheduling even more.

On top of implementing various filters and tools, our team designed a set of shift repeating patterns with the idea to speed up the scheduling process and make things easier for managers and schedulers. In this step by step tutorial, we’re going to show you how to make the most of this useful feature.

Once you specify the exact start and end time of the shift as well as an optional shift label or note, you can set a specific shift to repeat by using any of the following automated patterns:

**“Daily”** – This repeating pattern allows you to repeat the shift you are creating for a certain number of days in a row. There are two additional parameters you can configure once you set the “Daily” pattern: the number of days to repeat in a row OR a date when to complete the process of repeating. The end goal in both ways is for your shift to be repeated each day until a certain date or for a certain number of times.

**“Weekly”** – This shift repeating pattern allows you to repeat the shift you are creating for the same day of the week for a certain number of weeks in a row. Again, like with the previous pattern, you will have a chance to set the number of repeats, or simply select the date when you wish to end this repeating procedure.

**“Every weekday (Mon-Fri)”** – As the name suggests, this repeating pattern will simply repeat the shift you are creating on every day between Monday and Friday. Like with the previous patterns, you can set the number of repeating times, or you can simply select the end date by which you wish to end this Mon-Fri repeating process.

**“Every Tues, Thursday”** – In case you need a bit of un-ordinary repeating pattern, you can decide to repeat the shift you are creating on every Tuesday and Thursday, again for a certain number of times or simply end it by a specified date.

**“Every Mon, Wed and Fri”** – If  you need a bit of an unusual repeating pattern for your employees’ shifts, you can use this one and have a shift repeated on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for a certain number of times or simply until a certain date.

**“Every Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri and Sat”** – This repeating option will allow you to set your shift to repeat on every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. You can set this option to repeat for a certain number of times or end it on a selected date. With this pattern selected, you will cover all week days, except Wednesday and Sunday.

**“Every Mon, Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat”** – This repeating option allows you to repeat a specific shift on every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. It can be repeated until the selected date is matched or for a specified number of times. With this option, you will cover all week days except for Thursday and Sunday.

**“Every Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri and Sat”** – With this option selected, you will have your shift repeated for all week days except Sunday. In case your employee needs to cover 6 days in a week, without Sunday, this is the right pattern to use. You can set it to repeat for a certain number of times or simply set the end on the desired date.

**“Every X days”** – Another popular repeating option allows you to repeat a certain shift every X days. Once you select it, you will have a chance to set the X variable to any desired number. Again, like with the previous options, you’ll have an opportunity to repeat this pattern for a certain number of times or just repeat it until a certain date is matched.

**“On for X days, off for Y days”** – This is one of our more advanced repeating patterns. It allows you to repeat a shift for X days and then pause for Y days. When you select it, you will be able to select both X and Y variables so, for example, you can set a shift to repeat for 5 days, and pause for 2, or set it to repeat every 7 days, and then pause for 1 day. With this option, you’ll be able to select the date when you wish this repeating process to end.
