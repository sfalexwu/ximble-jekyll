Besides creating schedules for their employees, managers and company owners frequently need their data exported for the third party processing. Whether such an action is required for an internal company process, or to simply print out or manually make some changes, our schedule maker offers a couple of ways to export any schedule to a desired file format.


<blockquote>_**You can easily export your employees’ schedule for the whole location by using the “Export” option above the schedule.**_</blockquote>


Once you click on it, you’ll get a few file types to choose from, including:

**• PDF**
** • CSV**
** • Excel**


### 




### PDF


A PDF file format can be opened via Adobe Acrobat Reader. In case you do not have it installed on your computer, you can get it for free from Adobe’s website. This export file displays a list of employees on the left hand side with assigned shifts next to each of your employees' names. To give you a better idea of how a PDF export file may look like, here is a screenshot of an export file from one of our demo accounts:

### CSV


A CSV stands for a Comma Separated Values file and it is basically a plain textual file with a set of comma separated values, as its name already suggests. By default, you may see a CSV file on your computer being open by your Microsoft Excel, and the file may look almost the same as an Excel file, although in reality that’s just a text file that you can even edit by using Notepad. Here’s an example of columns and data included in this CSV export file:

### Excel


An Excel export file, as its name suggests, allows you to have your schedule exported from the system in the Microsoft Excel’s specific file format. As with any other excel file, you’ll get a set of data separated across different columns and cells. To give you a better idea of how our excel export file may look and what kind of data is included, please take a look at the screenshot below:
