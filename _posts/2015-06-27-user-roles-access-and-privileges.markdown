<blockquote>**In an ideal world you would have a chance to manipulate each part of any software and specify who can access it, how, from which device, etc.**

In reality, since that’s a bit hard to achieve, NimbleSchedule designed different work schedule roles that can be easily assigned to specific users in our employee scheduling system with a set of pre-defined privileges for each role. At the moment, we have 4 different user roles:</blockquote>


**• Employee**
** • Scheduler**
** • Manager**
** • Admin**

This is a default user role for each user being added to the system. It comes with a set of pre-defined schedule maker access rules and privileges and is basically designed for majority of your employees. A user set as an “Employee” will have read-only access to almost all the features in the system. In other words, an employee can view his/her own personal schedule and clock in and out when needed. All other options for the “Employee” user role are optional, and could be enabled or disabled. As an example, you can choose whether or not you want your employees to be able to view everyone’s schedule, to view their personal time sheets, to send private messages to other users in the system or to be able to change any setting on their profiles.



**Scheduler User Role**

As its name suggests, the “Scheduler” is allowed to manage the scheduling system for the location where he/she is assigned. This is a slightly more advanced role than the “Employee” role and, besides all the other standard features that any employee has in the system, the main feature of this user role is the schedule management. The “Scheduler” will not have access to the requests section or other user profiles. In case you prefer to keep your employee pay rates hidden from the eyes of the person creating the schedule, you are safe with us. The “Scheduler” does not have access to such data.



**Manager User Role**

With NimbleSchedule, you can easily set your managers on per-location basis. Once you set a user as a “Manager”, he/she will have a quite high privilege level. Apart from the schedule management, a manager can also approve various requests coming from employees, approve or edit time clock records, run various reports, edit employees’ profiles and many other useful things. The “Manager” will always be restricted to actions that affect only the assigned location as well as to those employees from his/her location. The “Manager” will not have access to any other employee data or requests beyond the location (or locations) where he/she is assigned.



**Admin User Role**

The easiest way to describe the admin role is to say that an “Admin” has access to everything. Plain and simple, an admin can use all the features in NimbleSchedule without any restrictions.
