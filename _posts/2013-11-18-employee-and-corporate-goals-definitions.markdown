Less than that and you're likely working in a muddle._

## Employee and Corporate Goals




## Definitions and Alignment


_

**Goals are tough nuts to crack.** We've written in the past about [insisting upon Employee Goals.](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-satisfaction/) Often a bigger problem is that corporate goals are little understood, not agreed upon and not even well disseminated (communicated) throughout the organization. Try aligning that with your employees' own individual goals.

You might think that smaller companies with fewer employees have it easy. But you'll be surprised how few of them have clearly defined and little understood goals. If "making money" were a legitimate goal, then we'd all be in the clear. The fact is, for most organizations, it's the only goal and it fails spectacularly.

Worker productivity gets lost in the mix, in part, because their goals are not your goals and neither of you understand each other. In part, it comes down to communications, but it also comes down to openly establishing, understanding and reinforcing your mutual commitment to reaching each other's goals.


## Aligning Individual and Organizational Goals


Working on Internal Communications is not always an easy task. But to really get to the bottom of your goals misalignment issue, having a working, functional two-way Internal Communications program in place is essential. Your employees should already know that you want to hear from them and that you want to hear from the regularly.

If you're moving from a "money, money, money" no-goals mental framework, to one that puts values first, and that respects your employees goals, then you need to be regularly polling, surveying and soliciting feedback from employees.

There's no two ways about it.

Now, before you leap ahead to your post-"money, money, money" goals as an organization, keep this in mind.

You haven't heard your employees' goals yet.

Here's what you get from asking for them and reading the answers.



	
  * Real insight into who is working for you

	
  * Real insight into how you can satisfy them (and keep them)

	
  * A much stronger idea of what your broader organizational goals might look like


There are lots of ways to go about getting these goals from your employees, but you SHOULD NOT ask them to answer multiple choice questions or choose goals from a list. That's a bad disengagement tactic that's going to make you look lazy.

You can ask them to write an email, or you can create a simple survey and ask them to respond.

This is best done by team, and obviously, larger organizations need more people looking at, commenting on and supporting the goals of your employees. The more people involved, the better informed your broader organization will be.

Aligning these goals should be done with reference to your organizations stated and published list of values.

You really can dictate strategic goals to all of your teams and all of your people. But they tend to make more sense if they're based on and developed from real insight into who and what your company is. Make sure they line up, complement one another and include the reaching of the goals of your people, especially your top people and your best performers.
