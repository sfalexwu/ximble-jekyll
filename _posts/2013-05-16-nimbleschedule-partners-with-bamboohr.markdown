<blockquote>**NimbleSchedule and BambooHR integrate their software services, giving clients of both companies a more flexible Human Resource Information System.**</blockquote>




**Carlsbad, Calif.** Carlsbad based workforce management software developer NimbleSchedule announced the integration of their NimbleSchedule.com platform with BambooHR’s web-based Human Resource Information System (HRIS). The integration allows clients of both companies to interact seamlessly between the NimbleSchedule.com and BambooHR.com solutions.

The integration of the two systems was completed earlier this month, and allows clients to access services across the two platforms from either the NimbleSchedule or BambooHR portals. Both companies aimed their efforts at minimizing the time that small- and medium-sized businesses spend managing human resource-related issues, like time and attendance.


“We want to make business easier,” said Ben Peterson, BambooHR’s chief executive. “We live in an age when business should not have to choose between quality analytics and flexibility. Cloud-based services, like BambooHR and NimbleSchedule, give growing companies the quality and control they want with the flexible options they need.”
