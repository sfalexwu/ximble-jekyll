When working with teams of employees, particularly with larger groups of staff members, a certain level of flexibility in their schedule is always to be expected. No matter how strict your company policy may be concerning this topic, once in a while an employee will have to trade a shift, or have someone else cover for his shift. Finding coverage or the right person to trade the shift with is a time consuming process and it usually involves a lot of phone calls among employees. 

In order to offer more flexibility, especially to those companies where employees do not work from the same location, or to the ones having a lot of employees that could possibly cover an empty shift slot, our team designed the “Drop shift” option.

As a completely optional feature, you can enable shift dropping by checking the “Employees can drop shifts” option in the Settings section, “Schedules” sub-option. Once you do that, besides trading shifts and finding coverage, your employees will have the third option that allows them to submit a drop shift request. Now, no need to panic, that’s just a request that still needs an approval.

While requesting to drop a shift, an employee will also be able to fill in the reason for dropping that shift from his schedule. Once an employee fills that in, the request comes to the manager or administrator for an approval. The manager will be able to see which shift is dropped and the reason for that. By all means, the manager will have an option to approve or reject such a request.

• If the manager decides to reject a drop shift request, an employee that sent a request will be notified about it and will definitely know that he still needs to work during that shift.

• If the manager decides to approve a drop shift request, then an employee is again notified and the shift automatically goes from his schedule into the Open Shifts area. Once that happens, the manager has two choices:





  1. To leave that shift in the open shift area for other employees who are eligible to pick up to apply on their own;


  2. To manually re-assign that shift from the open shift stack to another employee who has the right role.



Once the drop shift request gets approved by the manager, the system will notify all available employees and then, they can apply to pick up that shift. Instead of having an employee have a bunch of emails or phone calls with his co-workers in an attempt to find someone who could cover for him, you can let the system do the work for your team.
