Carlsbad, California - NimbleSchedule announced today the ability for customers to run NimbleSchedule on their own private instances of Microsoft Azure. With this offering, customers gain control over NimbleSchedule configuration and datacenter location, and can keep sensitive data private. The announcement closely follows the general availability of NimbleSchedule 6.17, the latest version of the most intuitive online scheduling solution on the market today.

The adoption of Azure has improved the overall application performance so customers can now enjoy the ease and speed of the online scheduling process. Additionally, by offering reliable uptime and availability, Azure has ensured NimbleSchedule's advantage over its competitors.

Enterprise companies have significant investments into private cloud technologies. This is prevalent with customers in highly regulated environments, or where there is a deep level of application integration. "We now offer the ability for customers to deploy our NimbleSchedule software on a separate Azure instance. With many Microsoft datacenters around the world to choose from, customers can select the location closest to their physical location and manage the NimbleSchedule app through their own private Azure instance," said Peter Swaniker, the Companyâ€™s Founder and CTO.

"Modern companies require a flexible and reliable technology solution that will let them focus on quick cost reduction, and we are committed to helping them succeed as they move toward the cloud," said Garth Fort, GM of Partner and Channel Marketing, Microsoft. "NimbleSchedule's workflow management system showcases the flexibility and the ease of deployment on Azure, where customers have the flexibility to choose between multi-tenant hosting and private instances."
