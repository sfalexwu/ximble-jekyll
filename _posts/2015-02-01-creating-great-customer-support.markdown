No matter if you are about to start a business or you manage an already developed company, the importance of providing great customer support is a must. Whether you sell a product or offer a service, the reliability and level of your support is of an extraordinary importance. Although selling a product is the most important part of any business, if your support team fails to keep your customers happy afterwards, then it was all for nothing. As with any other part of your business, building a team of employees that will keep your client base happy is a process that needs to be nourished and re-assessed from time to time. Here are some tips on how to make that process easier and how to achieve better results.

**A customer support representative needs to be a good listener**. Aside from his technical expertise or other competencies, a customer support representative needs to show good manners at all times and must not interrupt customers when they are complaining about some problem or explaining some of their issues. A customer support member needs to listen to customers carefully, and make notes about complaints. If a support representative cannot resolve the problem straightaway, he is to ensure the client that he understands what the problem is and that he will follow-up on that issue with senior colleagues or other company experts. The last thing that should be done is to simply ignore the problem that the customer has brought out . Hence, _being a good listener is a must_.

**A good support representative can make customers feel appreciated**. Whenever available, a customer support representative should address a customer by his or her name. This gives a personal stamp to a conversation and shows that the support representative cared enough to remember the name of the client. There is nothing worse than a support agent addressing clients with _"Dear Customer"_ or _"Dear Client"_. It shows that the representative didn’t want to bother himself with remembering a customer’s name. How rude, isn’t it?

**Anticipate issues and be prepared for them**. If you notice some issue repeating more than a couple of times, then prepare yourself for handling it in advance. Assess how that issue could be resolved permanently or come up with a decent workaround which you can suggest to your clients once they start complaining. In case your team is already working on resolving such an issue, then have an estimate on how long it will take for them to finalize. On the other hand, do not promise too short deadlines that you cannot fulfill. _Providing a reasonable estimate is of a key value_.

**Always follow-up**! No matter if your existing customer complained about some issue or requested some sort of an upgrade, make sure to provide a timely follow-up action. By doing so, you are _showing to your client that you didn’t forget about their problem_ and that you have a good customer support system that  keeps track of all requests and priorities.  In case they complained and you resolved the issue, give your customer a day or two and then follow-up again to see if they noticed any improvement in your service or product. 

**Provide customers with multiple means of communication with your support team**. While majority of people nowadays prefer using a phone, keep in mind that some of your clients might be working unusual hours and may need to contact your support during the night, or perhaps only online without the use of a phone. Providing an _email, live chat or ticket customer support system_ is a great way to show your customers your flexibility and willingness to go the extra mile to keep them happy.

**Know when and how to apologize**. Recognizing your own mistakes or flaws of your product or service that somehow affected your client is a virtue of a true professional. In such situations one should not hesitate to apologize to clients. It doesn’t cost anything and it will mean a lot to them.
