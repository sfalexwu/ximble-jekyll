According to statistics, unemployment rates in the IT industry seem to be amongst the lowest ones. From tech support personnel, networking architects, programmers and other software engineers, the demand seems to be growing. With such a shortage of top tech talents, the salaries and hourly rates of good IT personnel are skyrocketing. Even with the [outsourcing](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/outsourcing/) process on the rise, with all top tech companies hiring tech experts from around the world to fill in gaps in their company positions, the challenge of finding (and keeping) the best tech talents is becoming a cutthroat game. Recruiting top talents during the years ahead of us will be one of the biggest challenges in the IT industry.

Furthermore, as we’ve already mentioned in one of our previous articles, ([4 Ways to Keep Your Office Millennials Engaged](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/4-ways-to-keep-your-office-millennials-engaged/)) millennial workforce has become the main engine of the US labor across all the industries. Along with such a generational change, the culture and trends have also shifted toward using the latest technologies across various aspects of modern businesses. The modern workforce wants more flexibility when it comes to their schedule hours, easy ways to check their roster, [swap shifts](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/quick-and-efficient-shift-trading/), monitor work hours or request vacation days. The number of clicks on a computer or screens that need to be touched on the smart phone are becoming units of measurement for company procedures nowadays. This trend will become even more prominent in the future.

Many traditional company operations have shifted to [cloud-based technologies](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/cloud-technology-revolution/). Whether you need accounting software, employee scheduling, time tracking, payroll, HR software or anything similar related to staff management, cloud computing has a solution for you. With the development of various cloud technologies, cloud systems offering a solution for various aspects of modern business operations are everywhere. The reasons for this high demand lie in some of the things already mentioned above, but there are certainly many more. The process of simplifying and streamlining all the company operations is just a logical step. No more paperwork or old-fashioned desktop software taking a lot of time to maintain and manage. By utilizing cloud-based technology, company managers can significantly cut down on time wasted on payrolls, creating schedules or workforce management procedures.
