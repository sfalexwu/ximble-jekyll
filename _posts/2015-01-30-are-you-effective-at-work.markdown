Throughout your work career you must have found yourself in a situation in which you were not satisfied with your colleagues and their speed of work and results. But, how about the other way around? Are you effective at your work and are you that ideal team member that everyone loves working with?

[![Working Effectively with Others](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/to-do-list-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/to-do-list.jpg)

Even though this is certainly not something you should beat yourself up on a daily basis as it could shatter your self-esteem being too big a bite to chew for some people, asking yourself this question from time to time might help you better grasp how others perceive you as a team member. Whatever the answer might be, here are some tips and tricks on how to work effectively in a team.

1)	Use to-do lists and reminders. There is nothing worse than waiting for your co-workers to finish doing their part so you could proceed with yours, and then suddenly discovering that they completely forgot about that and didn’t do anything. The same rule applies to you. Use all available tools on your computer or smart phone to remind yourself about important stuff to do. That way you will be one of those reliable team members at work.

2)	Communicate your achievements and intentions with your team members on a daily basis. Make sure you are on the right track while doing your daily assignments and communicate your work with other co-workers. Try not to bother them too often with your work related problems, but state your progress of ongoing assignments and projects on a recurring basis.

3)	Come to work and meetings prepared. When heading to a meeting or work, don't forget to bring the documents you might find useful. In case you are keeping notes about your project progress, make sure they are in your briefcase before you leave your house.

4)	Keep your work desk organized. No matter if you work in an office with your co-workers or from a home office and you communicate with your colleagues online, try to keep your work environment and your desk, in particular, well organized. Always know where your documents or files are; whether we are talking about folders on your computer or piles of paper on your desk. This will save you a lot of time when trying to find a specific piece of information.

5)	Avoid procrastinating any sort of work activities. Of course, this might be a bit tricky to achieve, especially if you have a lot of duties or if you are a good employee and your boss always relies on you to complete a lot of important tasks and projects; however, whenever possible, avoid delaying any meetings or task deadlines. If that involves slightly [better time management](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/) on your end,  or doing some tricks in order to [increase your productivity](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-productivity/), then so be it. Organize your work hours better in order to achieve more.

6)	If you commute via public transportation every day, try doing some minor tasks during that time. Especially if you spend 30-60 minutes (or more) traveling by bus or subway, then try to use that time more efficiently and complete some minor assignments. If nothing else, just go through the list of tasks for that day and come to work well prepared.

7)	Constantly improve your [work related habits](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/bad-workplace-habits/). Avoid being a person that thinks only of himself. Avoid nourishing bad workplace habits and try to constantly learn and improve yourself. As Abraham Lincoln once said: _“I don’t think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.”_

8)	Take a moment or two to reflect on a daily basis. What were the things that you achieved during the previous day or week? What are those things that you could have done better? Do not dwell over some failures, but try to learn from mistakes and take your following opportunities to make an improvement. Working effectively with others is an easily attainable goal for those who are aware of the benefits of good team work.
