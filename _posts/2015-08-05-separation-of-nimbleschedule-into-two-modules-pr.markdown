### Nimble Software Systems, Inc. Announces the Separation of NimbleSchedule into Two Modules 




**Carlsbad, CA:Â ** Nimble Software Systems, Inc. announced today the separation of its workforce optimization application into two modules: Time Tracking and Employee Scheduling, thus enabling its clients to select and pay for the option(s) they need separately.



<blockquote>"The separation of NimbleSchedule into two stand-alone products was a natural step," said Peter Swaniker, the CTO of the Company. "Our esteemed clients will now have an opportunity to choose whether they want to use either one, or both modules.  That way they will be able to focus on the service they actually need and use on a daily basis."</blockquote>

We aim to please our clients." stated Chip Hanlon, the Director of Sales at Nimble Software Systems, Inc.</blockquote>
