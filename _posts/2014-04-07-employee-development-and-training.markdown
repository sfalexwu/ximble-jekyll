### Four Vital Points to Keep Employee Development and Training Front and Center


Employee training and development is important - and few employees ever really consider why.

**But those who get it - who understand the why and what and how of development and training - are your star performers.** They expect it, and the more your schlep it off or let it pass as secondary in importance, the more star players your organization is going to lose.

**Better employees expect you to keep up your side of the deal.**

But the vast majority of employers neither provide training, nor fully understand its importance nor its value.

We won't go into [exactly what your training and development should look like,](http://www.eleapsoftware.com/free-training-resources/strategic-value-workplace-training.htm) whether it's formal training classes or ongoing articles or seminars or just meetings. Below are some of the most important considerations for bolstering, supporting and supplementing your training - or just an understanding of that training.

**1. Employee Training and Development is About Sealing Your Relationship**

Every job interview includes a question about where the employee is going. "What goals do you hope to achieve?" But by and large, that's very often the end of it.  If you don't follow through with facilitating the reaching of those goals, then you shouldn't be surprised when people walk out. This is a painful lesson for lots of employers to learn, and many of them will never learn it.

Don't be among them. But keep the following in mind too.

**2. A Customer-Centered Organization needs to be learned.**

Your customers' experience happens with employees.  Great experiences depend on well-trained and knowledgeable people. Get strategic about client and customer service. If your employees know your product and your company inside out, then find out where they want to go, and what they want to know and help them to get there. They'll pass all of the enthusiasm back into the business - and that's always invaluable.

**3. Rely on Your Veterans**

The people who've been there the longest have the expertise you need. Not just for promotions to management, but for understanding and teaching the skills they are relying on every day. Recognize them. Applaud them when necessary, but especially, open up a way for them to affect the skills being taught and discussed.

**4. Optimize Every Communication to Support Employee Development and Training. **

We've delved pretty heavily into [optimizing your calendar emails](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/calendar-software/), but they're just one of the frequently overlooked communications emails. Much like the recent trend toward optimizing transactional emails for marketing, all of the methods you use to communicate with employees can and should be optimized to support development and training. Whether you're adding tips and tricks, or secrets to getting a better job done, there's a lot to be communicated. Some companies will keep the training and development formal and simply announce the next training session in their newsletter. A better strategy is to have a reporter attend the session and then to share the learning far and wide.

This is one more reason that the Human Resources Generalist has become such an important role within any medium or large organization. No matter what challenges your organization is facing, top-down management from the past is probably not going to solve the problem. Making your organization smarter is also, always, about it making it more efficient, more innovative and more risk averse. That sounds like a very tall order, but by holding on to the right people now, and working with them, you'll be well on your way.
