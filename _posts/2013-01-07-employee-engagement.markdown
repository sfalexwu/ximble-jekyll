# Employee engagement is more than a buzzword from the HR industry.


Employee engagement is real, matters big time, and it something that managers can start working on now.

**Performance may be everything. But employees aren't machines,** and they won't ever be, and those who continue to ignore the basic tenets of employee engagement will always be losing out to the firms who take them seriously.

When employees are given the opportunity to reach their own highest potentials, any organization connected with those employees is guaranteed to benefit. Customers get better service, much higher efficiency rates are achieved and overall waste is reduced, or even eliminated. Striving for peak performance means enhancing every aspect of employee engagement and continually monitoring for way to improve it.

Low employee engagement costs and costs real money, in terms of poor performance, disinterested sales or other performance numbers and wasted time, energy and resources.


## Employee Absence and Lateness Issues


Imagine telling your late employees that it's all fine. Want to miss a day? Just let us know. Want to work double shifts? No problem.

**Lateness and missed shifts are one big indicator that your employees are not engaged and they've got other priorities.Â **

It may seem counter-intuitive but giving them what they want may also be exactly the solution you need. Imagine getting better engagement while seemingly rewarding exactly the behavior you'd been planning to stamp out!

But look at it this way; respecting their priorities is a huge step toward getting them to respect yours!


## Matching Priorities is the First Step to Better Employee Engagement


**NimbleSchedule is designed to allow any organization to measure and quantify absence levels** and lateness and to analyze those numbers. While giving your employees more freedom to come and go as they please, you're also getting far better data on who is really performing. Even if they're doing it in less time, or more at their own pace, you get a much better picture, no matter the skill level or job level or title. Matching time worked with job performance indicators could not be easier.

**Getting a fuller, bigger, brighter picture of who is engaged is easier too.**

That lack of employee engagement has a way of contaminating anyone and everyone around the disengaged employee. Resentments over additional pressures and increased workloads make all kinds of people unhappy. Next thing you know, even diligent workers are disengaging. With NimbleSchedule, managers are able to quickly see who is working when, who is clocking-in or clocking-off when, and they can reward the diligent and better control those whose other performance numbers don't meet the standards set.

Just by knowing the scale of any unscheduled absence issue managers are better able to address it and get adequate solutions in place for the workers who deserve them. It's something you simply cannot do with paper records and called-in lateness excuses.

**NimbleSchedule is an automated real time management solution** designed to give even very large organizations clearer processes and better control. That's at the same time that it's increasing employee engagement and improving performance numbers across the board.

We work with performance teams in every industry to show you how you can better provide flexibility and scheduling ease so that managers can better monitor engagement. Instead of working and re-working complicated shift-schedules, they let their teams do that on their own, and concentrate on keeping employees engaged.

**NimbleSchedule** then puts the reports and the custom numbers in place so you get a first hand real time view of what just happened. With your teams' performance, or with multiple teams competing, it's easy to see who's on top and where the adjustments need to be made.

With improved employee engagement at the top of your priorities, you may just wonder how you focused on the minor details for as long as you did.
