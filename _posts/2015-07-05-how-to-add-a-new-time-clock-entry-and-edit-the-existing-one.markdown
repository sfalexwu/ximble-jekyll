An automated tracking system for employees’ time clock entries is what almost any company needs these days. Why? Because you can set everything up, let your employees clock in and out, then simply process entries for the payroll report through an automated time clock calculator.



**Add Clock Time**

Our engineers designed a separate page for the process of manual time clock entries.

Another option for easily adding a new time sheet entry is using the Timesheet page. In the bottom left corner of that page you’ll notice a button labeled as “Add New Entry”. When you click on it, a new row will appear on the page allowing you to fill out those fields and add an entry for one of your employees. When you fill in an employee's name, the data and time of his time clock entry and select the position, you can save everything by clicking the “Save” button on the right.

**Editing Time Clock Entries via Timesheet Page**

Quite similar to the procedure described above, you can easily edit any of your employees’ existing time clock entries. You just need to find the right entry you want to alter, and once you do that, click on the “pencil” icon on the right which will allow you to edit those in-line fields of the specific time sheet entry. You’ll be able to edit a start date, a start time, an end date, an end time, the note, the position and, optionally, a job code in case that option is enabled on your end. As soon as you finish editing, you can simply click on the “Save” icon on the right, and you are done.
