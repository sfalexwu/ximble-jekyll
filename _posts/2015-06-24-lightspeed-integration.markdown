NimbleSchedule is happy to announce the integration with LightSpeed, the Montreal based software company. This great retail and POS system provides cutting-edge solutions to all kind of businesses, with the main focus being on restaurants and retail stores.

To connect your LightSpeed account with NimbleSchedule, please navigate to the "My Account" link in the top right corner of the panel and select "Applications":

You will be directed to LightSpeed's system where you can enter your login information and confirm this new integration. Once you do that, you will be taken back to your NimbleSchedule account in order to configure some additional fields you would like to synchronize.

As you can see on the screenshot, you can select to import your sales information from LightSpeed to NimbleSchedule and you can choose whether you want to import time clock data or export time clock data.

In case you decide to import sales information from LightSpeed, your chart on the dashboard will start including your sales information vs your staffing costs.

In case you decide to enable importing of time clock entries or exporting of time clock entries from NimbleSchedule to LightSpeed, you will notice an additional option appearing on your Timesheets page, which you can use to import or export time clock data.

NimbleSchedule will automatically flag all the entries you have already exported to LightSpeed and it will warn you if you try to export duplicate entries. Note that in order for the export to work, your location name in NimbleSchedule must match your shop/store name in LightSpeed. For the time being, you can choose to import entries to export them to LightSpeed, so these options exclude each other.

Stay Nimble!
