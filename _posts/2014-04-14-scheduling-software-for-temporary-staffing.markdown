## Temporary Staffing and Scheduling Software


Scheduling software for temporary staffing sort of makes you wonder how staffing agencies ever got along without it.

A few big temporary staffing agencies, in fact, make up some of NimbleSchedule's happiest customers.

But this article is actually for the organization that has brought on an agency to fill temporary or short term staffing needs. It may very well be that: "[Companies consistently use contingent workers to deal with ups and downs,](http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/strategic-workforce-planning/staffing.aspx)" but that doesn't necessarily mean everyone is an expert in dealing with them.

Any human resources manager knows that working with temporary staffing agencies can open a whole different, and very complicated, can of worms. Workers themselves can misunderstand who the employer is and far too often, supervisors and managers can also misread or misdirect temporary employees. Avoiding  “co-employer” status can take some effort and some know-how.

**Keep these six tips in mind for scheduling and working with temporary staffing agencies and their people.**


### 1. Reputable Temp Agencies


Stick to working only with a reputable temporary staffing firm. They may not be the cheapest. But they are experts in compliance with complicated and potentially expensive labor laws no matter your regulatory environment.


### 2. Coordinate Messaging


You may share scheduling software (Nimbleschedule makes it easy) but you and the staffing agency need to adhere to strict delineations and responsibilities. A good staffing agency will understand the needs of both sides and walk you through any gray areas.


### 3. Brand Agency Emails


If your email notifications or texts are branded, (and they should be), be sure that temporary workers are receiving messages branded by the staffing agency - even if the agency is integrating with your scheduling system.


### 4. Distinguish Between Bosses


That same thought extends to every other action your organization takes towards temporary or outsourced help. If you feel that your staffing agency is not doing enough to distinguish their employees, and to prevent "second-class status", you are at liberty to discuss it with them. Many staffing agencies are very protective of their star performers (hence the high fees to hire them outright) and will work with you to keep communications and direction clear.


### 5. Get it in Writing


Document everything. A written contract is essential. Delineate the employment relationship, the responsibilities being covered and responsibility for unemployment taxes, Medicare contributions and for the entirety of regulatory compliance. The Fair Labor Standards Act, which normally governs overtime payments, also needs to be discussed and understood. Again, reputable temporary staffing agencies will be more than happy to discuss and inform you on all the relevant details.


### 6. The Agency Sets the Hours


If your agency places a supervisor onsite (your site) work with the supervisor to be sure that the staffing agency remains in control of the employment relationship. The agency needs to set hours of work and this is where your software may very well come into play (or into conflict). Even if you're dictating hours, the agency should be informing workers. Training, pay, discipline and facilities use are all up to your staffing agency, but they may need very clear instruction from you.


### 7. Play Fair


****Anti-discrimination laws still apply. Race, gender, religion and any other protected classification bear no weight in your decisions as to anything going on in the workplace. Check that any employees getting over-time pay are actually receiving it and that your written contract accurately describes the agreement you've come to as regards overtime.

In part, because NimbleSchedule is designed even for the truly demanding scheduling needs of temporary staffing agencies, we're also good with everyone else. If you want to discuss your own specific needs, give us a call. Or leave a comment or tip in the space below.
