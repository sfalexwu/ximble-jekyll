NimbleSchedule offers a quick and easy to use payroll reporting system based on your employees’ time clock entries. No matter how big or small your company is, it takes seconds to generate a payroll report using our fast and modern employee scheduling and time clock system. Parameters for running a payroll report are easily customizable, which makes our system flexible enough for a variety of demands and industries.

By using no other software than your browser, you can access our online SaaS system and perform all needed operations, including running a payroll report. Here is the explanation of a couple of useful options you can use while running a payroll report for your workforce.

### Selecting a Date Range for the Payroll Report



One of the first steps you’ll probably do is to select a proper date range for which you wish to run a cloud payroll report. Unlike some less flexible online systems, our software allows you to select any date range you prefer. There are absolutely no restrictions on the pay range or the number of times you can execute a payroll report.



### Payroll Report Location Filtering



Our workforce scheduling and time clocking system allows administrators to create an unlimited number of different locations for easier employee management. With that fact in mind, our system allows managers and administrators to filter only specific locations for the payroll report, while leaving out the ones you simply do not wish to cover by the report. By default you will always have all locations selected, so there is nothing here that needs to be done, but if you wish to break down your staffing costs per location, then that’s certainly an option.



### Employee Selection



Our modern payroll reporting system allows you to run an employee payroll report for a selected group of employees only, if needed. From the list of employees you can easily select an option to include all employees into the report, or you can refine the report by selecting only the desired employees. In case you have just registered with NimbleSchedule, you’ll notice that the list of employees on this page is empty unless your employees already have at least one approved time clock entry. Hence, if you are a new user, always make sure that your employee time clock entries are approved prior to running a payroll report.



### Optional Columns to Include



On top of the default parameters that will be displayed with each payroll report, our system also offers an option to select additional parameters to include. Those additional parameters are: Employee ID, Job Code, Location, Position, Pay Rate and Shift notes.



### Overtime Calculations and Breaks



As one of the most important features of our modern employee management cloud system, you can select a specific rule for overtime calculations when running a cloud payroll report. Those options currently allow you to simply ignore any overtime hours and calculations, or to select a Weekly overtime calculation or California overtime.  Additionally, if you’d like to have your employees’ unpaid breaks deducted from the total number of approved hours when running a payroll report, you can simply select an option to exclude those unpaid breaks on this step.



### Payroll Report Available in Two Formats



Once you have selected all available options and fields, you can proceed to running a report. By default, you will be presented with two options which allow you to see a detailed payroll report or a summary report. The detailed report will simply list details for each of your employee time clock records with a total listed for each employee whereas the summary report will simply show the total for each of your employees. Depending on your specific need, you can run any of these two available payroll report types.
