How many times did it happen that after a hard working day you finally got to see your family and your kids, and all of a sudden in the middle of the dinner you remembered some working task you should have completed that day but completely forgot about it? If that task somehow involved an important client or your employees, then you definitely had an excuse to excuse yourself from the dinner table and leave to finish your important task. However, by the time you were done your kids had already fallen asleep.

Sometimes the work never ends, and no matter how many different tasks you manage to complete by the end of your working day, there is always something from work on your mind. If you start dedicating yourself too much to your work and spending less and less time with your kids and family, will they grow apart from you? Will they feel underappreciated, especially when they compare themselves with your work?



[![Balancing work and family](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/business-and-parenting-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/business-and-parenting.jpg)



Balancing work and family may be the key for good parenting and good business handling. Being a good leader does not necessarily have to mean you need to spend less time with your children. While many will argue that you can never strictly separate your business from your private life, there are always certain measures you can take to create a better balance.

If you are a workaholic, then you might find it hard to leave certain tasks to others to complete, but sometimes that can become a necessity especially if you want to keep your relationship with your kids and dedicate more time to them. As a company leader or manager you do not need to micro-manage everything. [Delegate certain tasks to your employees](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/) and just supervise the execution, thus relieving yourself from all those not so crucial company tasks and eventually gain more time for your family.

If possible, start to get up earlier in the morning and complete some tasks before your kids are even awake. Make the most of your lunch breaks and spend them with your kids, or get out of work earlier than you usually do and pick up your kids after school or see them play their important basketball game. Attending important events for your kids will definitely create and maintain the healthy bond between you, but may also charge you with more positive energy that will reflect on all fronts, including at your work if the work means a lot to you. So you won’t be losing anything.

Overseeing some of employees’ activities by using your mobile phone or tablet may also help you a lot in such situations. With the advancement of technology a lot of work can nowadays be handled through Internet, especially by using various cloud based services, such as Dropbox - file sharing or NimbleSchedule - SaaS employee scheduling. Have your to-do list in your cell phone and complete certain tasks on the go. This will save you a lot of time that you can dedicate to your child or your spouse. Use the technology to your benefit and create more free time by utilizing all possible gadgets.

We believe that balancing work and family is a matter of choice. If there is a will, there is always a way. Be creative with as many work duties as you can so that you could gain more time for your family. Try to dedicate at least one evening during the week to your kids, and spend some time talking or playing with them, or simply take them to see some movie. Make that a weekly habit and your kids will remember that till the rest of their lives.
