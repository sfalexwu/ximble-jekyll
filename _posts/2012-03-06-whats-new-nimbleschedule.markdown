**1. Drag & Drop Shifts Across Employees**
We have an exciting update. In an effort to make scheduling as easy as possible we have added drag and drop capabilities to the schedule view. While on a "day" view for a schedule, in order assign a shift to another employee you can simply pick up the shift and drag it to another employee. Note that in order for the employee to accept the shit, they have to be in the same position

**2. Add Labels to Shifts**
Another requested feature we recently added is the ability to add label to shifts. When creating and editing shifts, you can now add a label or title such as "AM" or "PM" to the shift which would then show up on the schedule.

**3. Multi-Location Support**
We recently re-worked the schedule view to now indicate the location in the schedule to make it easier for employees who work in multiple location to see all their shifts on one page with the location clearly marked.
