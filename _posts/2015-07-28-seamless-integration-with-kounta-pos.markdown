If you operate a retail business, then the chances are high that you are aware of how useful it is to stay on top of all your income versus costs so that you could successfully keep your business running. Unfortunately, excel sheets or various print outs can cause a lot of headaches and they can easily lead you to miss some important pieces of information.

In order to help you run your retail business easier, our software engineers and developers came up with a perfect solution which allows you to integrate our work schedule software with the Kounta POS system. With such two powerful systems in sync, the outcome is a combination of both the sales and the staffing costs data. And that’s not all.

If you already have an account with Kounta, then you can easily connect both ends. All you have to do is to navigate to the My Account section; from there click on the Applications and then click on Kounta's label or logo. The system will take you to your account with Kounta to approve this synchronization. Once you have this step completed you can choose what kind of options you wish to enable for this synchronization.

• Import sales information
• Import staff data

**Import sales information** – This option allows you to automatically sync your sales info from Kounta POS and show it on the chart on the Dashboard page compared with your staffing costs. By using this option, you’ll get a live interface to the sales vs costs comparison at all times.

**Import staff data** – As the name suggests, this option allows you to synchronize your employee info from Kounta into NimbleSchedule. By using this feature, you can skip the step of manually adding your employees into NimbleSchedule or importing them from an excel or a csv file. If you already have your team listed in your Kounta account, then you can simply enable this option and see your staff data automatically synced with our work schedule system.

Stay Nimble!
