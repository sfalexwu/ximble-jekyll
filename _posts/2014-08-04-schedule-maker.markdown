## A schedule maker's look at why employees want flex-time.


Employers very often look at flexible scheduling for all kinds of reasons. It's not difficult to look around the internet and find [all kinds of reasons](http://mashable.com/2013/06/19/flexible-work/) for implementing your own program.

It's not difficult to see that they're after high quality charges who are leaders in their respective fields—and who simply aren't going to tolerate some old school calendar posted on the wall.

But understanding flexibility means more than simply instituting the option and appreciating the great work your newly engaged employees are now doing.

Although NimbleSchedule is designed to easily adapt to the needs and conditions set by your human schedule maker, we have seen some flexible scheduling nightmares. The point of this article to highlight what the worker experiences so that you can adjust your own scheduling as necessary.

**1. Better coordinate across time zones.**

Lots of business writers just stick the word "Global" in there to sound important, but even small businesses are often relying on far away contractors or employees. Now you're asking one team to stay late, and another is waiting until morning. Before you know it you're paying over time because somebody somewhere is, well, waiting. Let the same people flexibly schedule on or off the clock and you've got fans for life willing to work - or not work - all night and into the wee hours of morning.

**2. Better live like humans**

Working regular business hours is living the life of a zombie. Every single thing your people need to do needs to be coordinated with a home office that very quickly starts to feel like a ball and chain. Adding even a little bit of flexibility to that nightmare existence immediately loosens the chains that strangle creativity, that destroy loyalty and fuel resentment. So, if you're back fresh on Monday morning with a crowd of listless, disloyal and distracted, resentful people, ask yourself; "why am I ruining these people's lives with my 19th century scheduling technique?"

**3. Better Commuting**

The whole thing of organizing entire cities and regions to travel at the same two "Rush Hours" of each day was ridiculous. Car driving is not exactly [good for mental health anyway](http://tranbc.ca/2012/10/10/7-secrets-to-taming-driver-stress/), but driving everyday through the same gauntlet of congested and frustrating commuter neighborhoods is downright dis-spiriting. So are crowded buses, subways and train-stations. Flexible scheduling is not just good for your employees' mental health, it shows your company's commitment to the community and to the wider world. Take a position on commuting, and encourage public transportation.

**4. Better Time Keeping**

Appointments, kids, practices, sessions, meetings. Everything in your life gets delayed when you have to run it through the office schedule maker's compliance rules. Give your people back a little time - during normal business hours - and you'll be rewarded. Loyalty, even devotion, come from employees who are allowed to responsibly look after their families and obligations.

[**5. Continuous improvement**](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/continuous-improvement/)

This is actually one we talk a lot about here. Try to cement this one into place in your head: **Employees Want their Workplace to Be Always Getting Better.** They also want their own lives to get better. Connect the two concepts, and you should be making money. You've suddenly got growing, dynamic people. You've got employees who not only can think about their own loves, educations and futures, but they can devote some of that free time to making your operation more efficient too.

**6. Better results during fixed hours**

Four hours of fixed-time and four hours of "when-ever time" packs a lot more punch into those fixed time hours. You'll be amazes how quickly people coordinate so that they can have a little more "when-ever time."  What they get done will surprise you and please you, and overlapping mandatory fixed times end up making a lot more sense.

**7. Say Goodbye to Personal Time Off & Sick Days**

Maybe not entirely, but most organizations who institute even a minimal flextime or flexible scheduling program say goodbye forever to the unpredictability of time-off. Two hours of flexible time, scheduled when you want it, and you've got your life back. Crazy how that works.

If you are an employee, or you're benefiting yourself from right there in Human Resources, we'd like to know exactly how it's worked for you, how it's changed your life - and your job. Please leave us a note in the comments section below.
