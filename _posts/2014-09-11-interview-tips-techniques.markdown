Being asked to an interview is great news by itself yet there is a long way in front of you before you actually get the job. In order for you to win this final round, we have prepared a couple of tips and techniques that will enhance your interview performance and professionalism and boost your chances of getting hired.




Before the interview make sure to:




1. **Do a company research** - take your time to gather background information about the company you are applying for. This should be your top priority while preparing for the interview because letting your potential employer know that you are familiar with the company's past, present, and future will be a big plus for you. It will not only show to him that you are truly interested in the working position but it will also make the interview more interactive. The starting point for this research could be the company's website, more specifically, the ["About us"](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/about-us/) page, where one can learn what a company actually does. While browsing the company's website, try to find the "Our mission" or "Our story" page as well because you could learn about the company's visions and goals on those pages. Incorporating them in your response to the usual question "Why do you want to work for our company?" might impress your interviewer and differentiate you from other interviewees.

2. **Adjust your resume to the position you are applying for** - in particular, emphasize your skills, values and strengths that would be an asset to the targeted company. Aligning your CV to the position in question can be one of the most successful interview techniques if you manage to highlight your skills and abilities that will contribute to the company's success. Think of all your previous accomplishments from different aspects of your life, analyze them and identify the ones that could be related to the requirements of the new working post. If the results were positive, be ready to talk about them, paying special attention to the situations that would showcase the successful usage of the mentioned skills and competencies.




3. **Practice and simulate the interview** - this is one of the best interview tips and techniques because while practicing for the interview, either with a friend or in front of a mirror, you will gain confidence, reduce interview anxiety and sharpen your communication skills. At this stage of the interview preparation, try to anticipate what questions you will be asked and devise the most optimal answer. Having this role-played interview video-recorded is worthwhile as it can show some non-verbal aspects of your performance - your body language, voice, attitude, all of which can be corrected for the grand finale - the real interview for the job itself.


During the interview:


4. Keep in mind that t**he first 30 seconds of the interview matter most** - in other words, it will take your interviewer only 30 s to form an opinion about your personality and intelligence and, consequently, whether or not you will fit into the team. Therefore, be prepared to sell yourself for that limited time and remember that your appearance, attitude and body language are of vital importance.
•    Select your outfit carefully, taking into consideration the company's dress code. You will never make a mistake if you stick to business-like attire - something conservative and neat.
•    Introduce yourself in a firm voice, smile occasionally and maintain good eye contact
•    Sit upright and rest your arms on the arms of your chair. Avoid leaning back and crossing your arms. Do not cross your legs but put both your feet on the floor. If you are nervous, hold a pen or pencil.
•    Be pleasant, polite and sincere. Participate in the conversation and do not hesitate to ask for clarification.
•    Prepare a couple of questions that you would like ask the hiring manager. After all, an interview is a two-way conversation in which both parties assess each other's fit.




After the interview:




5. **Follow-up with a thank you e-mail**, reminding the interviewer of your values and skills at the same time showing to him that you are interested in the job and you are ready to take an initiative to get it.




If you have followed these interview tips and techniques, you can expect a call-back from the hiring manager informing you that you actually got the job. Good luck!
