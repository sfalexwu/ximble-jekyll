## The Importance of Human Resources Management is Just Beginning to Be Understood;  The Latest Trends and Technology Show a Burgeoning New Frontier of Opportunity


HR used to be a sort of support department, tagging along management and trying to keep up with the personnel changes and needs as they came up.

But as technology redefines the industry, the importance of human resources management has leapt to the vanguard. Keeping your business profitable, and on the cutting edge is not just about the technology you're using, selling and buying. It's also about keeping key performers working with you, keeping them happy, and learning from how they do what they do.

**Bigger and mid-sized companies are already learning to learn.** They 're tracking, analyzing and tweaking all kinds of performance numbers, and the numbers that come back are always more interesting. The importance of human resources management data, analytics and numbers are among the most interesting of all.

Big Data, Mobile and the move to the Cloud are a part of it - but by now, that's all pretty much old-hat. Last year's trends are established, standard operating procedure now. But how they're affecting human resources management is among the most interesting developments across the business landscape of the last year - or so.

As mobile has interrupted the workplace and the over all technology landscape, so too it continues to interrupt the normal way of managing personnel. But just as GPS allowed fleet managers to better monitor drivers and vehicles, so a range of devices and chips and cards are helping HR to better collect data and use it.

These are some of the most important developments to keep in mind as your assessing the importance of human resources management in your own organization.


### Ongoing Training, Support & Staff Development




You might be surprised how much employees love the chance to better themselves, on-the-job, and while everyone else is working. Eclasses, video and conference room lectures and training make it affordable and easy. With automated class and course scheduling, and attendance checking, it's easy to see who's doing what, when and where. And you bet your staff will love it.





### Smart Badges and ID Cards




Bluetooth, RFID and similar broadcasting technology pairs up easily with your calendar or time clocking software and makes data collection easy and increasingly valuable.





### Complex Locations Management




This one stems from the GPS systems mentioned above, but multiple locations enterprises are actually buying back franchises that simply couldn't be managed before. Today's technology allows multi-state and regional operations to effectively keep an eye on all kinds of people doing all kinds of tasks, all from the same interface and in real time. Now imagine trying to do that over the telephone.





### Internal Email Marketing




Just as companies are learning B2C communications - primarily from more successful B2B operations - they're also learning to better communicate with employees. And they're using mobile apps,  text messages and calendar software to do it. Task assignments, shift changes, and job specifications are all going out, tracked and turned around. Location assignments that used to be a lot more complicated are easy and even appreciated by pressured employees.





### Compliance Easing




Automated and management generated break, vacation and and other reminders are a lot easier. They can out employee acknowledgement into black and white and let all kinds of companies avoid labor law disputes, while applying the same marketing-influenced "soft touch" to even bad news.
