The latest release of our workforce management system has brought many exciting updates and enhancements, one of them being **the separation of NimbleSchedule into two modules**: Scheduling and Time Tracking. Do not worry if you need both components because that’s definitely still an option. 



<blockquote>If you are an existing client, then you probably haven’t noticed much of a difference when it comes to this separation because you’ll have both Scheduling and Time Tracking enabled by default. However, if you navigate to the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the page, you’ll be able to choose just scheduling or just time tracking from the “Price Plans” page. Disabling one of these modules will simply hide all functionalities related to a particular module.</blockquote>

This change made to our workforce optimization software enables companies that need just Time Tracking to hide all Scheduling components and vice versa.



<blockquote>Accordingly, the newly adopted pricing structure is fair to all clients. Those who need to use just one module, either Time Tracking or Employee Scheduling, will pay just for the model used, not for both of them. This allows your company to save money you would spend for an unneeded service and to focus on using just the part of the system that you need. Moreover, the ability to switch to either of the offered modules minimizes the confusion in your employees’ rows when it comes to some features being displayed, which your company simply doesn’t need to use.</blockquote>



The more flexibility offered by our system – **the more power in your hands**! Happy NimbleScheduling!
