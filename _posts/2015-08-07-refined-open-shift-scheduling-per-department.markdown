<blockquote>The ultimate goal of NimbleSchedule version 6.22 was to maintain our system's simplicity and ease of use, but also add a series of enhancements that increase flexibility and help save you time by speeding-up the scheduling process. </blockquote>





With think our new **Open Shifts Scheduling by Department** feature delivers on this goal beautifully. 

Now, while creating an Open Shift, you can refine the shift by position and by department, as well.

<blockquote>While matching availability for a specific Open Shift, the system will seek through your employee profiles and match the shift availability by both position and department. 

This narrows down the list of employees that can apply to pick up an open shift to just those that you need, and minimizes the amount of approval work that needs to be done.
</blockquote>



**Note: **

	
* In case you don't need the department functionality, you can simply disable it in your settings. 
	
* You can also keep the department functionality enabled, but choose not to specify the department option for your Open Shift. It's your choice.
