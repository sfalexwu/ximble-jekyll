Although it used to have a neutral connotation, criticism has started getting a negative tone lately. With the expansion of Internet use, a new trend emerged, the one of inserting all sorts of personal hate and vicious comments in, at first glance, open minded criticism. Therefore, it has become important for one to learn how to give and receive criticism. 

_Understanding before criticizing._ In order to criticize a product in the best possible way, first you have to understand what that product is and what it is not. If you simply do not understand the product and wish to criticize it because of not being able to understand it, you are definitely not on the right track. Take some time to learn about the product and about the intentions that person of the producer before providing your fair and unbiased review. 

_Fairness and positive sides._ When reviewing any type of a product or service, you have to insist on fairness. Before pointing out the negative sides and the things you don’t like, ask yourself about the positive things first. What are the things that you do like about some product or service? Isn’t it fair to point out those positive key values as much as the ones you find negative?

_Measurements and comparison points._ Can people who are not humble be good critics? Are the ones who think they know it all just too arrogant to be fair?

Before starting to criticize someone else's work, be sure you have a decent knowledge of the niche you are about to criticize. Once you acquire it, then take some time to investigate competitors in that same industry and check what values they have to offer. With those things in mind, and with a vision of what measurement standards are, you can start writing your fair opinion about a specific product or service.

_Never focus on personal things._ If you are criticizing someone’s articles, why would you focus on that person instead on a specific article? If the person writing those articles is not pretty according to your standards, or wears a funky looking sweater, how does that affect the quality of the written articles and their content, in general? **A good criticism should never be personal.**

Knowing how to receive and process a constructive criticism could be the key to your professional success. There are many things you can learn from a good analysis of your products or services, so try to make the best use out of it. Such an attitude is very important especially when it comes to accepting criticism at work.

_Avoid arguing with malicious critics._ Remember that such criticisms speak more about those declaring them than about you or your work. Restrain yourself from falling into a trap of arguing with such people. Nothing good can come out of it.

_Give your critic the benefit of a doubt._ There is no person in the history of the world that was always right. With that being said, remember that there is always a probability that you might have gone the wrong way with some work or product. Hence, scrutinize your work routine and re-check all the steps you have made. Try to visualize what the results would be if you did things as written in that critique. 

_Refrain from giving sarcastic or arrogant responses._ Be positive and accept every objective criticism as a man! Wining around and showing an unprofessional attitude will just ruin your reputation. Always provide a courteous and polite response and take some time to evaluate the things you've heard or read about yourself.
