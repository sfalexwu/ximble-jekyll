Here are some of the perks of modern HR management systems and trends that will dictate how HR industry will most certainly evolve.



#### Mobile devices


As mentioned above, the rapidly developing smart phone and tablet industry is really shaping how various industries operate nowadays. Due to extreme popularity of such devices among millennials, yet not restricted to them only, the HR software industry naturally had to follow. Modern HR platforms offer various smart phone and tablet apps that both HR managers and staff members can utilize to manage certain tasks.

An employee in a modern company can now easily check his PTO status, accrual days or various documents attached to his profile. Such systems allow employees to update their important information on the go, the same way as HR management can obtain certain information in or outside the office through a range of supported devices.



#### Ease of use


Modern HR platforms are extremely easy to use when compared to various desktop systems, or, not even to mention, the old-fashioned pen and paper approach where HR departments had to store all that paperwork in folders and drawers. 

HR software is nowadays designed with an intuitive interface that allows everyone, regardless of their IT knowledge and level, to manage the software easily and effectively. Complicated installations or configurations are also part of the past, as modern platforms usually require just a couple of steps in order for everything to be configured and ready for use.



#### Real time tracking


Of course, the cloud technology allows real time tracking as part of the process. This allows more accurate data to be gathered at any given time as well as a better decision making process due to up-to-date information. Certain requests or updates can be handled in a matter of minutes, allowing both employees and management to make better plans and decisions with live information.



#### Actionable reports


Naturally, various actionable reports accompany real time tracking. Implementing predictive analytic solutions was a logical step with all the information tracked through the automated system, which allows further data mining in order to predict certain trends among employees. For instance, if someoneâ€™s productivity suddenly decreased, HR management can easily predict if that means that an employee is close to quitting his job or anything similar. Such information allows the HR to act pro-actively and prevent any serious churn among the workforce, when needed.
