Posting an ad for an open position in your company sounds as a piece of cake, yet if poorly formulated, it may cause you to waste hours and hours of your time talking with the candidates not well suited for your exact needs. If we add thousands of websites and posting boards for job advertisements to that formula, some of which cost even a couple of hundred of dollars, then obviously this process should not be taken so lightly. Knowing that you can waste considerable amount of money for job applicants not exactly qualified for your post, you should be very careful when advertising job position. Here are some basic guidelines which will make your job opening look irresistible:

Step 1: _Carry out an in-depth analysis of the job opening and gather all the requirements an applicant should meet._ Although it may take you some time to analyze thoroughly all the duties and tasks you wish your new employee to perform, having a list of the right skills in your job ad post will be beneficial when you advertise job openings in general.

Step 2: _Choose the right medium for your job post._ There is an increasing number of online users every day on the global level and companies more often than ever use online resources and boards to advertise job openings. However, for some types of businesses, especially for small businesses on a local level, advertising job position in local newspapers may produce better results than on the Internet. On the other hand, with so many directories and websites targeting specific niches, online ad postings may reach a wider audience. Ranging from free to post websites to those that charge up to a couple of hundreds of dollars for such a post on their website, there are plenty of resources to choose from.

Step 3: _Create an appealing job description while clearly pointing out the applicant's requirements._ If you are advertising job position online, then you will probably have more space to write something about your company. A couple of positive and energetic sentences describing your organization and working environment may attract more qualified workers to apply for that open position. At the same time, be very clear and specific about both the applicant's qualifications and job requirements so that you would not waste time with the ill-suited candidates. Do not hesitate to underline or bold those parts of the text with the most important competences. If the ad is too general and non-specific, then you are in risk of wasting your time and effort by having inadequate candidates applying for the post.

Step 4: _Always include the company/post location in your ad._ By doing this you will exclude those potential candidates who do not live near the company and as such are not willing to travel significant distances on a daily basis. Furthermore, you will save considerable time which you can use to focus on other, more appropriate candidates.

Step 5: _Be careful when selecting paying ad services._ Some websites offer unrestricted access to their workforce database where you can browse for specific candidates on your own. If you decide to use such a service, then make sure you have previously read the reviews about their targeting niche and the number of the active users in their databases. On the other hand, if you select plain board post websites, then try researching their targeting audience or the number of visitors, which may give you a better picture whether or not they are worth spending the money. Reading some reviews about those websites and services may save you a couple of hundred of dollars so make sure you do that prior to advertising job position.

When you start receiving resumes or notifications about new applicants, have a new hire's direct supervisor help you with the initial screening process. As someone who will be working with the new hire on a daily basis, you probably want to hear their input as well and keep your current team members happy.

Do not hesitate to repeat the whole procedure if the right candidate was just not there in the first attempt. Waiting for a while for the right person may just pay off in the long run.
