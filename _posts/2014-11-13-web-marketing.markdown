With over 40% of the world population being connected to the Internet, the significance of web marketing and online presence is huge. Developing a proper online marketing strategy may very easily mean a difference between success and failure in the modern technology world.

In the last couple of years, the form of web marketing  has changed and there are new trends and web marketing solutions for presenting your brand and content to the Internet users. The trends are slowly sliding away from direct web marketing tools like AdWords toward content writing and gaining organic website visitors. Although paid advertising campaigns through such networks may instantly boost sales and increase the number of visitors, companies have started focusing on adding rich website content in order to attract more visitors.

Nowadays having a well designed, modern website is a must. From there, as a business owner or manager, you need to develop a good search engine optimization strategy. Pay no attention to those who promise instant results by implementing the so called black-hat techniques. Keep your content fresh and clean as search engines can detect and penalize websites for applying all those tricky web marketing tools.

Start by promoting your business website and services through Social Networks. The networks like [Facebook](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/) provide a lot of free web marketing tools through which you can present your company  to a wide audience in the best possible way. In case you need extra attention and you are not patient enough to wait for slow growth of your Facebook business group, you can always use its paid services and rapidly increase your fan group.

Article and blog writing is an excellent way to promote your website. By writing industry specific news or some entertaining articles, you can also attract visitors to your website. These days a lot of companies utilize this method in order to attract some organic visitors from search engines.

The power of opt-in email newsletter services is also amazing. Building a large base of users willing to receive occasional newsletter containing product updates or industry news is a powerful resource. At the same time, this method should be properly developed and provide users with an option to opt-out; otherwise, some unsatisfied members from the newsletter list might start reporting your newsletter as spam and you may earn a bad reputation or get blocked by certain email servers.

Writing and publishing online press releases is an excellent method to announce important things happening in your company to the general public. There are websites that are specialized in PR publishing and general content publishing so after establishing some connections with such websites and blog owners, you can attract more visitors and potential clients to your website.

Another very successful option is building various affiliate or reseller programs. Let other webmasters and business owners do all the work for you and drive you traffic or sales. There are many website owners with visitors and traffic to share, looking for the best matching products to offer to their audience. Do not hesitate to build such a program in order to gain more customers and more sales.

By following one or more of the above mentioned web marketing solutions, you can create an excellent start for your web marketing strategy. Depending on the exact niche of your business, there might be other tips or tricks that you can utilize in order to gain more visitors and  a higher sale rate.
