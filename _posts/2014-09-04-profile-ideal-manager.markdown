Although every one of us has his or her own picture of an ideal manager, some of the preferred traits do overlap thus making defining of the ideal manager key skills easier.

1. The starting point for such an endeavor can always be knowing exactly what the responsibilities and obligations of the manager are. Something that is implied is the manager's expertise and competence, that is to say, his ability to get the job done while applying the highest possible standards. Yet, there are many more underlying subtle factors indicating whom we may call an exceptional manager, an excellent supervisor or a good team leader.

2. Everyone wants to work in a positive work environment with an established code of conduct which implies, among other things, fair treatment of all the employees. Therefore, a perfect leader will build effective relationships, the ones based on respect and trust.

The times when managers were just order-issuing authorities are bygone. Nowadays, in order for one to be a respected and efficient manager, it is recommended to assume the role of a coach, the duty of whom is to motivate his subordinates, encourage them in their improvement at the same time showing empathy.

Developing strong bonds between the leader and his followers and nourishing the cult of mutual trust and understanding is something that should be aspired to within any organization. It should be listed in the desired skill sets for managers.

3. In almost all work environments, conflicts are inevitable. The catch is how to diminish them to the least extent possible, if not to eradicate them totally. An experienced manager will be able to find proper ways and means to deal with them. The causes and reasons for conflicts can be diverse, ranging from having so many different personalities at one place to misunderstandings about assigned shifts and/or tasks. A true leader will possess the manager key skills that will enable him to overcome all the possible conflict situations. Some of those skill sets for managers will be innate and some acquired. Frequently, challenging situations can also be prevented by utilizing efficient software solutions, such as NimbleSchedule.

NimbleSchedule enables managers to spend less time scheduling shifts while taking into consideration all of the workforce conditions. Instead of wasting his time on leafing through a notepad, or juggling an excel spreadsheet trying to create an efficient schedule, systems like NimbleSchedule gather and display such information at one place while creating employees' schedules on the managerâ€™s behalf. A working method like this one gives the manager much more time for other activities and tasks.

Additionally, NimbleSchedule gives more freedom and independence to employees who benefit from an easy and simple access to their working schedules via their computers or smart phones at any time of the day or night. Workers become more satisfied as they get an opportunity to trade shifts with their co-workers, leave time-off requests and pick up the shifts that best fit their everyday obligations.

Once the flare-ups are under control, team members can focus on achieving the organizational objectives.

4. One of the key time-management strategies is "Delegate more". A good manager is aware of that fact and will act accordingly. Additionally, he will welcome and value new ideas offered by others thus fostering a sense of teamwork. Apart from that, a natural-born leader will lead his employees into new challenges, encourage them to climb the ladder of success and make the most of their knowledge and expertise. Above all, he is a charismatic person who, by his own example, shows to others how to behave in an organization. He is something that is called a true role model.
