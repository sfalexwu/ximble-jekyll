We are very pleased to announce the release of the latest NimbleSchedule update, which now includes QuickBooks online integration. With this addition, all customers using QuickBooks Online for their accounting needs will have an easy way to export their employee timesheets with one click directly to QuickBooks

As with all other updates, this is a **free** addition to NimbleSchedule.

To get started, select QuickBooks from the “Applications” section of NimbleSchedule and after going through the authentication process, you will notice a new “export to QuickBooks” option on the timesheet.

The system will automatically flag all the entries you have already exported and it will warn you if you try to export duplicate entries. Note that in order for the export to work, your employees in NimbleSchedule must match what you have in QuickBooks. At the moment, only timesheet entries are being exported but we plan to expand this integration to allow you to import employees from QuickBooks as well.

Stay Nimble!
