Nimble Software Systems Inc. is very pleased to announce its latest integration release and addition of ADP to the supported list of payroll systems. With this addition, all customers can configure the system to export payroll reports in the ADP format, which is basically a CSV file that can be easily imported into ADP.

As usual, our team made this process super easy and simple to use. The first step includes the configuration of this feature. All you need to enter is your Company code received from ADP and you are ready to go.

Once you have configured this new feature, you can easily export your payroll report. Then, you can navigate to Reports section and Payroll report page. There you can select all the needed fields and optional parameters and run a detailed payroll report.

As soon as you generate a detailed payroll report, you will notice the “Export to ADP” button in the top right corner above the report. If you click it, the system will prompt you to save this export file. Choose an appropriate location on your hard drive to save this file.

With that exported file you are ready to login to the ADP system and import your payroll report. 

Our team continues with development of new features and integrations with other third party systems. Our goal remains to provide our customers with an easy to use and cost effective system for employee management with more HR and Payroll systems integrated. 

Stay tuned and stay Nimble!
