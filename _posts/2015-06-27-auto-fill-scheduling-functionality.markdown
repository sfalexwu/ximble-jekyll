Every manager that creates a weekly work schedule has probably been faced with complaints about why some shift was assigned to a certain employee and not to another.

To avoid such situations, managers often times seek automated tools that would simply randomize a shift creation without human interference.This way, everyone gets an equal chance at a certain shift and total work hours.

**NimbleSchedule's answer to this is our "Auto Fill" functionality.**

<blockquote>**If you have decided to create all your available work shifts as open shifts instead of manually assigning them to your employee profiles, then you will find the “Auto Fill” functionality very useful. It easily automates the scheduling process and randomly assigns pre-created open shifts to available employees.**</blockquote>


The system will follow all the rules you have set for your employees. For example, if you set so, a shift will be assigned only the employees with an appropriate position on their profiles and with open availability. In case an employee is not available for a specific time or perhaps he already reached his daily or weekly hourly limit, the system will simply ignore and skip this employee.

You can also utilize the “Auto Fill” option to simply speed up your scheduling process. If you need to create some order in the shift filling process, you can alternatively setup an employee ranking for all your employees and attach those rankings to your employee positions on their profiles. Once you enable “Use employee ranking while filling open shifts” in the Settings – Schedule section, your employees with higher rankings will be assigned with shifts first whereas the leftovers will be assigned to employees with lower ranks.

**Note that an employee ranking can be configured through the Settings – Employee section. So, the higher the rank an employee has, the higher the chance a shift will be assigned to him during the “Auto Fill” process.**
