From the moment our company was founded and our employee scheduling system released, we thought about ways to provide our prospects and clients with a functionality and technology rich system that would work across different industries. Even companies themselves approached us with various requests that all made sense. Based on such inquiries, our team worked on finding and designing the optimal hardware and software solutions that would easily fit across different companies and different needs.

After some hard work by all our departments and engineers, we now possess one of the technology and feature richest Time Clock systems on the market. At this moment we are supporting the following time & attendance technologies and methods:

• Computer/Web panel based Time Clock
• A Smart phone time clock app that supports iOS and Android
• A QR Code Scan method, working on iPad and Android tablets
• Time Clock via Text/SMS message
• Time Clock via Phone call (Call-in)
• Biometric devices / Fingerprint scanners
• Plus, a feature rich API system that allows the development of third party applications, including the Time Clocking component

**Web panel based Time Clock** allows all computer, or even tablet and mobile phone users to access the “desktop” version of our web panel and, among other functionalities, use our Time Clock system as well. Clocking in and out is super easy - all you have to do is click on the big button on your screen and that’s it.

On top of simply monitoring the Time Clock entries, administrators can also define Clock Locations and restrict their employees to clock in/out from specific networks only. This allows employers to allow their employees to clock in only from their office computers, while leaving the possibility to employees to access the rest of the system from any computer they like.

**Smart phone apps** – This is an optional feature that allows employers to choose whether or not they wish to enable employee clocking in/out via smart phones. Currently, we are supporting iOS and Android phones. With each such time clock entry, employees leave a GPS stamp which allows administrators and managers to determine the exact location on the map from which their employees clocked in. How cool is that?

**QR Code Scan** – By downloading and installing our additional Time Clock app for iPad or Android tablets, employers can now create a clock post with the use of their device, somewhere in their store or a restaurant, and allow their employees to clock in/out by flashing their printed QR Code card in front of the tablet. Our software was designed to quickly process such a request thus allowing large number of employees to clock in one after another without holding a line too long.

**Time Clock via Text message** allows company owners and administrators to allow specific employees to clock in and out by simply sending a text message. Not everyone today has a smart phone or a computer, especially not in some type of industries where employees need to visit a remote location to complete some task. In such cases, clocking in by sending a text message is a quick and easy way to handle this process.

**Biometric Time Clock devices** – NimbleSchedule offers a wide range of different devices you can utilize for your Time & Attendance needs. Choose among a variety of USB fingerprint scanners that need to be attached to a computer.

**API** - On top of all other methods, our feature rich API system offers third party companies to utilize our system, as well as our Time Clock and build a custom software solution according to their own needs.

As you can see, we have really invested a lot of time in designing all these different options just for you.
