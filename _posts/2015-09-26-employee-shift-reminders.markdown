It is a proven fact that companies frequently lose a substantial amount of money due to their employee absences or late arrivals to work. While sometimes that’s an intended result of unsatisfied or frustrated employees, or even lazy ones, most of the time such things happen by pure accident - either an employee forgets that he is scheduled for the shift or he simply misunderstands the exact time when the shift is supposed to start.  

To help companies cope with this kind of issue, we at NimbleSchedule designed a couple of very useful tools that will help employees stay on top of their schedule and work duties. Among those tools, the most useful feature proven to reduce the number of no shows and late arrivals is the shift reminder option that comes in a couple of variations. 

If you’ve been a NimbleSchedule user for a while, then you are definitely familiar with the fact that there are many different types of notifications each user in the system can choose to enable or disable. Among other things, an employee can choose to enable shift reminders via Email or SMS.

As you can see from the screenshot above, an employee can choose to receive “Upcoming Shift Reminder - 24 hours” or “Upcoming Shift Reminder – 60/90/120 minutes” via Email and/or SMS. Even though both options are more or less self-explanatory, let us point out the key values of both options.

**“Upcoming Shift Reminder - 24 hours”** – By enabling this type of notification, you will receive a shift reminder 24 hours before your shift starts. Depending on your preference, you may receive this reminder via email or text message.

**“Upcoming Shift Reminder – 60/90/120 minutes”** – If you decide to enable this type of shift reminder, you’ll be able to set it to alert you either 60, 90 or 120 minutes before your shift starts. As mentioned earlier, depending on your personal preference, you may choose to receive this notification via email or SMS.

Say goodbye to missed shifts or late arrivals due to pre-occupied thoughts of your everyday-life. Set one of these shift reminders and spend some quality time with your family or friends without having to worry about the time before your shift starts. Let our employee scheduling system do the work for you.
