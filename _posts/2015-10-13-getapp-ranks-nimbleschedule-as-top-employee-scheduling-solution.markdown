### GetApp Ranks NimbleSchedule as Top Employee Scheduling Solution 




**Carlsbad, CA: ** NimbleSchedule, a leading cloud-based workforce optimization software, announced today that it made it to the top tier of GetApp’s quarterly ranking of the top 25 employee scheduling apps on the market. GetApp, the largest cloud-based business app marketplace, gave NimbleSchedule a score of 63 placing it in the top 5 apps of the quarter.

Each app is scored using five criteria, each worth 20 points, for a total possible score of 100. The criteria include: security, integrations, mobile, reviews, and media. Every single app’s GetRank score is completely independent of commercial interests and existing relationships that GetApp has with app vendors. NimbleSchedule received the following scores in GetRank’s criteria: 16 for security, 15 for integrations, 15 for mobile, 12 for reviews and 5 for media.



<blockquote>GetApp co­founder Christophe Primault stated in their press release that "HR solutions are essential in helping an employer effectively manage current and future employees, whether with training, scheduling, or booking time off. Regardless of whether these functions are bundled as an all-in-one solution or are offered as a standalone product, HR applications need to be able to interact and integrate with each other in order to reduce the amount of time that a company spends on routine HR tasks."</blockquote>





<blockquote>"Reaching the top of GetRank's top 25 employee scheduling apps is a great honor for all of us at NimbleSchedule," said Sasha Poljak, NimbleSchedule CEO. "We wouldn’t be where we are today without the great reviews and feedback from our customers, as well as all the work that has gone into making our technology intuitive and seamlessly integrated with some of the best systems in the SaaS industry."</blockquote>
