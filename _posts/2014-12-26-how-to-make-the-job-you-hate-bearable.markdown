If you are one of those people who feel almost sick and noxious when having to go to work, by reading this article you will learn how to love your job again. Although the latest research shows that people are becoming more and more unsatisfied with their jobs, ask yourself twice whether or not this is the right time to change your career. Perhaps, undertaking certain some small steps might do the trick for now and make your job bearable.

[![Make Your Job Bearable](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/make-your-job-bearable-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/make-your-job-bearable.jpg)



Step 1: You do this work because you are paid to do it. Have satisfaction in the money you are making with this job and thatâ€™s it.

Step 2: With today's economy, consider yourself lucky to have a job at all. This is probably not the best time to change careers or look for another job, especially due to the economic recession. You might spend months looking for a new job, and even when you do find it, no one can make that guarantee that the new company will survive this recession. Therefore, stick with what you have.

Step 3: Do your work the best way you can. Even if you do not like what you do for a living, take some pride in your work results. There are many [problem solving techniques](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/problem-solving-techniques/) you can apply to make your situation look better. If you have to do this job, then give your best shot.

Step 4: Alleviate the lack of happiness with your work with an increase of happiness and contentment in your personal life. Spend more time with your family and friends, or find some hobbies that would occupy your mind. Regular physical exercises and activities, or jogging might help release some of the stress. If you are a parent, spend more time with your children and try to achieve true emotional satisfaction ([Business and Parenting](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/parenting-and-business/)). 

Step 5: Consider the possibilities to change at least part of your work duties. Is your manager perhaps interested in rotating some of the employees by assigning them different positions in the company? Are there any other tasks that you like more and that you could take on, which would eventually make your job a little more bearable? These are all the things you could explore discreetly without raising any eyebrows in your company. By slightly migrating your work duties toward new stuff, you might just turn your work day into a much more pleasant experience.

Step 6: Doing good deeds can make you feel better about yourself. In case your company sometimes organizes some charities or volunteer activities, try joining one and the satisfaction of doing a selfless good deed can make you feel much better about yourself and about your current job. Even if there is no such opportunity, tutoring or helping some younger colleague may bring that satisfaction you need at your work place.

Step 7: Focus on positive sides and stay strong. No matter what type of work you do, there always must be some positive side of it, as well. In case those negative things occupy too much of your attention, try focusing on positive things more.

These are just some of the things you could do to help you re-discover the reasons to love your job again and to make yourself feel better about your work in general. Depending on your exact line of business and circumstances, there might be measures from this list that you cannot directly apply in your case. Nevertheless, take it as a challenge to explore the new ways of improving your working environment and your inner happiness with your job.
