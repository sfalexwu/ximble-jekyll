## Summary of ObamaCare


**NimbleSchedule** works with so many small and medium sized business, it's in our own interest to always stay current with the trends and policy changes that affect them.

While the cost of health care everyone in the U.S. has continued to skyrocket, the number of smaller and mid-sized businesses able to offer any health insurance has basically cratered. ObamaCare, "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act," will reduce many of the premiums for individuals and for businesses. The aim is to achieve is basically by increasing the number of healthy people paying into the larger insurance pool.

Businesses with fewer than 25 full-time employees will be able to insure those employees, through tax credits, and employers with more than 50 full-time employees are mandated to pay a percentage of their employees' coverage. Most studies have shown that ObamaCare should help to generate literally millions of new private and public sector jobs. Nearly of half of those presently uninsured work for small businesses or are dependent on someone who does.


## Help for Small Businesses


As the number of far more affordable insurance options increases under the new plan, most small businesses will seriously benefit from ObamaCare, but will in fact benefit. Mid-sized businesses will, however feel the impact of new taxes and the insurance mandate.

While it isn't necessary to immediately slash the working hours of your entire staff, that has been the initial alarm sounded by some very high income "small businesses" who've been able to qualify as small businesses in the past, in part to avoid similar regulations. Fines ranging from $2,000 to $3,000 per employee per year are possible, in part, in order to cover the healthcare costs of those uncovered employees.

Business owners are currently limiting their own budgeting and planning due to uncertainty and while the insurance exchanges and other options are made clear.


## Are More Part-Time Employees the Answer?


Many businesses are considering limitations on the weekly hours that employees can work. At least until the options are clear, this may be a short term or interim solution. Preparing for change and better management during the transition is in every manager's interest.
