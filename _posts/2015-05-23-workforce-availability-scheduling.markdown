Our cloud workforce scheduling platform offers multiple ways to set your employee scheduling availability. Besides the regular time-off requesting system, our software also features two additional types of employee availabilities:

• Weekly repeating availability
• One time/Future availability

You can enable or disable any of these options though the settings section. Under the “Time-Off & Availability” settings section, you’ll notice two options that allow you to enable/disable weekly availability as well as to enable/disable future availability.

### Weekly / Repeating Availability



Once you enable “Employees can set weekly availability” in the settings section, all your employees will have the option “Availability Preferences” under their profiles. As an administrator or a manager, you can also access their availability preferences page through their profile.

Through this page, each of your employees can set the repeating availability that will simply repeat every week. In case your employees need to set themselves as not available on every Monday or Tuesday, for example, then they can simply do that through this page by setting the weekly availability.

There are two ways to block out certain days or time slots. The easiest way is to click on the day and time when you wish your unavailability to start and then drag your mouse across the row to mark the part of the day on your profile as unavailable. Another, again very simple method is to click on the day and time when you want your unavailability to start and release the mouse. A small popup will show with the start time already prefilled and you can simply enter the time by which you want your unavailability to end. 



### Future Availability



In cases where setting the weekly availability just doesn’t work, there is our so called “future availability” which can be set through the “My Schedule” page.

Setting this one-time availability is pretty easy as well. All you need to do is navigate to the right week, click on the day/time when you wish to start your un-availability and simply select the end time. Optionally, you can define a reason and leave a note on why you are not available on that specific day.

Again, if needed, you could repeat such future availability for a specific number of times using different repeat patterns our system provides. With this option, you achieve a similar functionality to the weekly availability, the only difference being that with this particular option you are setting your unavailability for a certain number of pre-selected days whereas the weekly availability will repeat indefinitely until terminated.
