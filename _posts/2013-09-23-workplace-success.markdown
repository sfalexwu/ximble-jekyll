It just takes some attitude adjustments and some love for what you do. Here's how to combine them in your workplace. _


## Workplace Success:




## Ten Points to Encourage Every Worker in Your Shop




## ______


This article is designed to give you the basics for a fun introductory or mid-season training conference.

It doesn't need to be endless, or even much more than an hour, but it does help you to establish priorities and set some standards for your people. All of your people.

**Here's what they need to know.**


### 1) Environment


**You take it seriously. So should they.** As of today, you need to hear what bothers them. Throw out the old, ugly art and bring in the new. It's important. And it keep people happy. That's just the beginning. It's their environment too. Let's make it better.


### 2) Organization


What's the official hierarchy? Why? How long has it been that way? Understand the aims, structure and purpose of the entire organization. That gives everyone a more confident and positive place to be (see above).


### 3) Values


Though [we've touched on Core Corporate Values in other posts](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/), there's still work to be done. Make sure everyone understands how you arrived at the core values and try to build enthusiasm around each of them.


### 4) Ethics


Not every company has to face issues of right and wrong. But slacking off and avoiding the tough jobs costs money. Good work ethics are cultivated and highlighting the best workplace behaviors is a good place to get going.


### 5) Organize


We said "Organization" above, but spend some time on how each of your employees can organize or optimize their own workplace. Point out **"best practices"** and keep them in peoples' minds - for good.


### 6) Creativity


This one is, ultimately, one of the most important. Highlight the true creatives - problem solvers, hands in the air types - who ever has really thought through completing tasks more efficiently, with better results or corrections. Everything counts.


### 7) Stress Management


Just pointing out that the organization knows about stress is a huge plus. It's a terrific way to get your employees on your side. Some techniques for coping - and some best-practices - are in order too.


### 8) No Taking Work Home!


This is a very good policy to enforce. Take a stand for work-life balance and your better people will be devoted to you. Again it's just a matter of understanding.


### 9) Attitude


This one can seem tough. It helps to go back to the values mentioned above, but if you haven't convinced the higher ups to go all in for a values-centered organization plan, don't worry. Instead, just crack a smile on the faces of even your most cynical players. That can lead to a big learning moment - for everyone! Mentioning attitude is also a great opportunity to highlight the creative, the ethical and the hard-working.


### 10) Respect


**We almost wrote "Getting Along" but this isn't the moment to force everyone to hug people they don't like.** Rather, use it as a moment to reinforce that one of your core values - however it's written - emphasizes common purpose with all customers, employees, and whoever else you can think of at the moment. It can include suppliers or delivery people and even the people cleaning the workspace. **Everyone deserves respect.**

Workplace success depends on all of the above, and for all of your people. Maybe most importantly,  **just mentioning all of the above also has a positive effect** on your entire work crew from team leaders down to the newest employees.
