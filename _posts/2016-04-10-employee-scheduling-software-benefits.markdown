Managing larger groups of employees brings a lot of challenges for supervisors and company managers trying to run their business operations smoothly. With many different variables in the mix, the last thing they need is scheduling software that can’t be flexible enough to cope with the demand. Right? Well, for that precise reason our engineering team went the extra mile to make a schedule creation and publishing layered enough to meet various needs and requirements.

If your company has a separate schedule for each location or department, or you need to publish a work schedule per one position/job at a time, NimbleSchedule's got your back.

### Publishing a work schedule per location basis



If you’re familiar with our software, you probably already know how well it handles separate schedules for each of your company’ locations. Namely, you can easily set your locations in our system, assign your employees to those locations and keep the schedule for each of your locations separated from one another.

Having a separate schedule for each location allows you to publish a schedule, one location at a time. There’s absolutely no need to have employees from one location notified about their schedule when it’s not ready yet, just because a manager from a different location needs to publish the schedule ahead of time. NimbleSchedule allows location managers to publish a schedule separately, altering the right group of employees only when their schedule is ready.



### Publishing a work schedule per department basis



As opposed to having different teams and different managers - per location basis, some companies separate their employees into departments, and have department managers. With that in mind, our system allows the creation of schedules per department basis when using the “Departments” tab on the schedule page. On the other hand, when using the Department filter above the schedule to filter out just one specific department, the system allows publishing of a schedule for just a selected department.

This method allows department managers to publish their department’s schedule only when it’s ready, without forcing other departments to follow their pace with the scheduling process. 



### Publishing shifts per position basis



Analogously, our system also allows publishing of a schedule for each position separately. When using the Position filter option above the schedule to view each position in the system separately on the schedule page, you can click on the Publish option and publish a schedule for just a selected position.

Allowing managers to publish a schedule for one position at a time ensures a more flexible approach for large groups, where positions and jobs with a higher priority can be assigned and published first, leaving other positions and shifts for later.



### Publishing of unpublished shifts only



NimbleSchedule features various notification types that help employees stay on top of their schedule at all times. When publishing a schedule in segments, you, of course, risk notifying some of your employees more than once regarding the same shifts on the schedule. If those employees were already notified, and there was no change to their schedule, then chances are pretty high that duplicate notifications could cause occasional confusion as well. In order to avoid such scenarios, our system allows company managers to publish only an unpublished portion of a schedule and leave out those employees who already had their shifts published.

This approach helps avoid any kind of confusion while sending out multiple schedule notifications and streamlines the whole employee scheduling process.
