Workforce management systems like NimbleSchedule can significantly improve overall company supervision and increase employees’ productivity. Aside from a variety of scheduling tools to make your job and life easier, and a reliable time clock module, NimbleSchedule features many different reports offering the performance and efficiency overviews. Here are just some of the things that you will find very useful about our employee schedule software, no matter if you are a business owner, manager or an employee.



### Scheduling conflicts – Part of the history



With our cloud employee scheduling app, having an employee scheduled in two places at the same time, or at least partially overlapping, is part of the history. While trying to schedule an employee you will get a warning that your employee is already scheduled somewhere else, and then you can make a decision where you would find that employee more useful.

### 24/7 access to your personal or employee schedule



No matter if you are an employee or the person in charge of employee scheduling, you’ll have 24/7 access to the system via computer or your smart phone. There is no reason to scratch your head anymore trying to remember your schedule for the following day, no matter if it’s the middle of the night or weekend time. With just a couple of clicks you can check your schedule and show up at work on time.



### Notifications, reminders and other goodies



Our developers and engineers developed a set of very useful notifications and reminders which you can choose to receive via email or SMS. Additionally, you can be notified about any kind of shift changes, last minute assignments or cancellations on time. If you are a manager of a team, you’ll appreciate getting notifications when your employees are late or when they request a time off. Being reminded 60 or 90 minutes before your shift starts can also be very useful. 



### Schedule transparency



If you work in an organization where transparency is appreciated and nourished, you will really like NimbleSchedule for having an option to allow all employees to view everyone’s schedule. Of course, you can easily disable that option if that’s not needed in your company; however, in case you wish to increase scheduling transparency in your organization, we certainly have the tools to make that an easy-to-enable option. 



### Ease of use



Using NimbleSchedule is a fairly easy process. With an intuitive menu and submenu options, every single option is reachable within 2-3 clicks inside the panel. There’s no need to waste your time anymore on some complicated time attendance systems or scheduling tools. With our user friendly employee schedule software, everything gets done super fast and easy. 



### Reports, reports and some more reports



Through NimbleSchedule’s rich reporting system, you can easily view your employee absence or late list, see who worked longer hours than scheduled for, who traded most shifts, or who picked up most of your company’s open shifts. You can easily access costing reports, broken down per location, position or department, and similar features. A myriad of different filters throughout various reports, as well as a possibility to export each of these reports via a CSV file makes NimbleSchedule's reporting system top of the line in this niche industry.

These are just some of the features and tools that will help you manage your company more efficiently, or perform better at work if you are an employee or a scheduler. With numerous partner integrations and improvements, we are boldly stepping toward the top of our niche industry.
