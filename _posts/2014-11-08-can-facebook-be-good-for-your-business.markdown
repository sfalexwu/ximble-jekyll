With the rapid popularization of social networks, the way business is handled is being transformed as well. More than ever, people use Facebook and other social networks to read reviews and comments of both known and unknown people about products and experiences with various firms. With this in mind, companies can greatly benefit from the advantages of Facebook marketing in the form of free or paid exposure on this social network.

By the end of 2013, Facebook reported to have over 1,230 million of active users around the world (that’s 1,23 billion people). With over 750 millions of users logging in through Facebook every day, this is obviously amazing potential to reach out to the right audience.

Establishing a good social media presence may be the key of success. In particular, small business firms have become aware of Facebook marketing benefits. Namely, developing a proper Facebook strategy is an important component of advertisement efforts. Such efforts may come at absolutely no additional cost, using available free tools for establishing a new social media presence and building a successful customer base relationship. Providing your customers with means of communication with your company or ability to track the latest company news and products through Facebook may result in an increment of loyalty and higher returning customer rate.

Although many companies may claim that the method of brand building through Facebook and other social media networks may be too slow, it is actually the best way for establishing a connection with your client base. If you are among the ones who have no patience to wait for results yet to come, paid advertisements through Facebook are also an option.

With an amazing set of specific targeting tools, Facebook ads provide you with a way to filter only those users with certain interests. This type of advertisements is a useful method for reaching out to the right audience, and it has significant advantages over other forms, such as TV, radio or newspaper ads. Even if you run a local type of business, you can filter users by the city or state and have the audience with right interests, within a reasonable distance from your actual store location.

Presenting your business in a proper manner through a free Facebook profile is the right thing to do, especially since it is free. Yet, it may have a huge negative impact on your potential clients if you were not interested enough to put some effort into presenting your company in the best possible way through the social media. In other words, clients may get a feeling that you don’t care that much about your image. Hence keep in mind that by presenting your company in an appropriate way through frequent interesting posts, among other actions, you can show that you do care about how people see your business and what your current and past clients think of your company.

One might say that small companies benefit the most from their Facebook presence and the tools which Facebook provides; however, big industry players are not completely unaware of social media impact so they invest a significant portion of their marketing funds in social media advertising. The good thing is that the tools that were once available only to those large companies are now available to anyone through the social media. 

There are no more excuses now that you've been presented with some Facebook marketing benefits! Your potential clients might be searching for some of your products or services through Facebook this very moment. Will they be able to find your business there properly presented?
