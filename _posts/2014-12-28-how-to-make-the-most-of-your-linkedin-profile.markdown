Why should your LinkedIn profile be any different from your Facebook profile? What are some tips and tricks you can apply while creating your LinkedIn profile to make it look more professional?

Let’s try to answer these questions while at the same time focusing on LinkedIn profile optimization.

Since LinkedIn is a business type of network, then there is a clear difference between Facebook and LinkedIn. While you can be goofy on your personal Facebook profile, LinkedIn is not the place for clowning around. Being fun and flaky on Facebook is OK, but when the time comes to leave a good impression on your business partners or potential clients and associates you might want to tone down a little bit.

Here are some of the key elements of having a professionally looking LinkedIn profile:  
  

• Have the right, high resolution, professional-looking profile photo. A recent headshot photo might do the trick. Your future employer, or potential client might not necessarily want to see your dog performing funny tricks on your LinkedIn profile photo. Keep it simple.  
  

• Add a short and straight to the point headline and summary. Both fields are equally important, so pay extra attention to make them sound clear and easy to understand. First impressions are important, so make them worth it.  
  

•	Proofread your posted information. Make sure you have used the proper grammar and that you have no spelling errors. Having such errors could leave an impression to your visitors that you did not care too much about creating the best possible LinkedIn profile.  
  

•	Customize your profile URL to something meaningful. Having a bunch of numbers in your profile URL might look a bit odd, or hard to remember. Do your best to leave a positive impression on your profile visitors. Having a meaningful URL is one of the ways to do that.  
  

•	Add detailed information about yourself. Consider that as a version of your resume, so make sure you write down your employment history as well as the duties you have done for your past employers. Also, don't forget to mention your current job position.  
  

•	Do not lie about anything. Nowadays everything can be checked very easily online, so lying about your work history or education would only show to your profile visitors that you are not a trustworthy person. You can perhaps skip something you are not proud of, but do not just make stuff up. That will look unprofessional.  
  

•	Use LinkedIn applications to enhance your profile. For example, if you are a blog writer, you can easily connect your WordPress blog with your LinkedIn profile and have your article topics appear there. You can also connect your Twitter if you believe your tweets would sound interesting to your LinkedIn connections.  
  

•	Add relevant keywords to your profile text. Keep in mind that people may be using search engines to find professionals from certain areas, so adding good keywords might help position your profile link on the first page of search engine results.  
  


Now that you have a professional looking LinkedIn profile, let’s see how you can get more exposure. 
Besides adding the right keywords for SE optimization, what are the other methods of getting some real and quality visitors to your profile and keeping your existing connections interested?

1) Use LinkedIn Groups. There are many different groups covering various niche industries. You can find a group covering your specific profession and try to be active there. Remember that some companies even post job ads in such groups, so try monitoring other posts as much as you can if you are seeking a job. If not, you can never know when a nice reputation among fellow colleagues from the same profession might come useful. So be active in those groups and gain some profile exposure from people that matter in your profession.  
  

2) Use LinkedIn badges on your blog, website or forum posts. If you own or maintain a website or a blog, make sure you have a decent place on your website with a badge that is linked to your LinkedIn profile. This will not only give your profile some additional exposure, but it will also tell your website visitors more about you and present them with your professional image. The benefits will be manifold.  
  

3) Add your LinkedIn profile link to your email messages. If you frequently communicate with clients, then it might be a good idea to add your LinkedIn profile to your email signature. This will create some additional exposure of your profile and, at the same time, your customers and clients will be able to see who you really are. Use that personal touch to create a better connection with your clients and add more exposure to your profile.  
  


These are just some of the measures that you can undertake in order to ensure LinkedIn profile optimization so do not be afraid to explore them to present yourself in the best professional manner.
