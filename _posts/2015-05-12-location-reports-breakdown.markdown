No matter if you just started your business or you are already an experienced entrepreneur, having easy to read and simple to generate reports could be extremely useful for monitoring your company's income and expenses. 

If you are a user of NimbleSchedule, then you've probably noticed a lot of powerful reports in our employee engagement system. One of the extremely valuable sections under the “Reports” tab is the “Locations” section. If your schedule is broken down per location, this is the right financial reporting section for you.

Once you navigate to the Locations section under the “Reports” tab, you’ll see a breakdown for each of your locations. See the image below:

As in each of our actionable reports, you will also see a filter with a couple of options on top of this page. This specific one allows you to filter only a specific location and/or refine a specific date range. Below, you’ll see a list of your locations along with a couple of columns showing very useful data for your cost monitoring. You’ll see a number of scheduled employees for each location, the number of scheduled hours and the cost for those hours based on your employee pay-rates set in the system. 

If you want to see a more detailed breakdown, you can simply click on the location name in the first column, and a new page will show up. On top of this page you’ll see a small chart, a summary report and a detailed breakdown per department and position.

This is the place where you can see a number of scheduled employees per each department, the number of scheduled hours as well as the scheduled cost. You can simply click on the department name in the first column and either collapse the data into a department summary or see a full breakdown per position.

Apart  from this breakdown per various parameters, you’ll also see a total at the bottom of the table.

As with all other reports in NimbleSchedule, you can export this report to a CSV file and use the data in some external software or adjust it for a specific printable report.
