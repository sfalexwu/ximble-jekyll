You can use a schedule template to organize your scheduling requirements in advance of the actual schedule. Building a weekly work schedule template will make scheduling fast and simple!
If you have a schedule that is fairly consistent from week to week, you can save this schedule as a template and simply re-use this template to create new schedules faster.
You can create as many templates as you wish. For example, you might create a templates called "Weekly Schedule" and use this from week to week or a template called "Holiday Schedule" with special scheduling needs for the holiday. To create a new template,  select the "Save as Template" button on the schedule page and give it a name. Note that you can save the template with the currently assigned employees or just the shifts.

To edit existing templates, **Navigate to the Schedules **tab to view the list of templates:

**Select the schedule you want to edit**

****just like the your regular schedules, each shift can be assigned directly to an employee, or left as an open shift.

To apply this template to a new schedule, select the "Apply Template" button, specify the day you want to start the schedule and the template will be applied from this date. If you saved the template with employees, these employees will be placed on the schedule. If not, open shifts will be created for you and you can then assign employees to these shifts later
