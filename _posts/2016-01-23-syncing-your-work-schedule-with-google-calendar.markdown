In mid-2015, Google reported that their Gmail service was used by more than 900 million users, which is more than double the number reported back in 2012. Various Google’s tools and products are yet to be fully leveraged in the years to come. This is why our team has implemented a couple of options along the way to make the usage of our online scheduler even easier for all Google/Gmail fans.

Aside from using Google credentials to login to our online schedule maker, there is another handy feature implemented into our system with the aim to make everyone’s work life a bit easier: 

**Introducing: _Google Calendar_ sync**

If you’re an employee level user in NimbleSchedule, you will find Google Calendar sync extremely useful. Namely, the system will immediately sync your [work schedule](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/) from NimbleSchedule into Google Calendar the moment it gets created. Depending on whether you check your Google Calendar on your computer or your Android/iPhone, such data will be instantly available on your end. If you’re a manager or an admin level user in our system, you’ll also be able to sync your personal schedule with Google Cal.

In order to setup this integration, all you need to do is to login to the system and navigate to the My Schedule page - if you’re the manager, or simply click on the Schedules tab - if you’re an employee. On that page, you’ll notice a couple of options in the top left corner above the schedule, which will allow you to sync your work shifts with a couple of different systems, as shown on the screenshot below.

In order to connect your personal work schedule with Google Calendar, just click on the G icon shown on the screenshot above, and the system will take you to Google. If you’re already logged in to your Gmail account, Google will simply ask you to accept and confirm this synchronization request and that’s it. In case you’re not logged in to your Gmail account, you’ll have to login in the first step, and then confirm the synchronization request. From that moment going forward, whenever your manager publishes or changes any of your shifts, your work schedule will be synchronized with your Google Calendar.

Let us also mention that your schedule will not automatically sync immediately upon connecting your NimbleSchedule account with your Google Calendar. Once the connection is made, this synchronization will simply wait for the next time when your shifts are created or edited. In case you’re a manager or an admin level user, you can just re-publish your schedule in order to see it sync right away. If you’re an employee level user, you can either wait for your managers to publish your schedule next time or simply ask them to re-publish it and you’re good to go.
