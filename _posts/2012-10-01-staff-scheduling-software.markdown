## Staff Scheduling Software That Gives Back


You already know that online employee scheduling and notification is the way to go. **NimbleSchedule lets you email everyone at once, and send text messages to those far flung employees who read everything off of their cell phone or tablet.**

NimbleSchedule manages employee schedules - weekly and monthly and rotating shifts - for doctors and hotel workers and restaurants. Staff scheduling managers breathe a lot easier and nobody misses work cause they didn't know about a shift.


### Referral Rewards that keep your Business Flush!


Now, signing up your neighbor's business or one of your suppliers has gotten that much more rewarding.

Let's say one of your suppliers keeps missing a delivery. Maybe the driver didn't know he had to show up that day. The driver's company is probably suffering through the same complicated scheduling and staff notification problems that you used to go through. And let's face it...

**Nobody knows remote workers and delivery drivers better than the customers on the receiving end! **(and that means YOU!)**
**

NimbleSchedule will pay all of our active customers back for business referrals. [Just check the log-on screen... here](https://app.nimbleschedule.com/authentication/signin?ReturnUrl=%2f) before you log on. Fill in your favorite referrals, or the company that you think needs a kick in the pants!

A new customer for us means better delivery, better services and more helpful providers, no matter who you're relying on. **It can also mean valuable gifts that are our way of saying thank you. These can include:**



	
  * **Gift Certificates**

	
  * **Apple iPods**

	
  * **Donations to your favorite charity**

	
  * **Or even future Credits toward your own NimbleSchedule subscription!**


Just submit your referral's name, address and contact info from the NimbleSchedule log-on page. When your referral signs up for a paid subscription to NimbleSchedule, we'll contact you. You can choose from any of the above gifts and rewards, and maybe most important, you'll see better work and delivery performance from your referral.

You'll also enjoy seeing that the business and performance of your referral is steadily improving as workers and staff members show up on time, and the entire staff is happier with the work schedules that they're better able to control.


## FlexTime Scheduling that Makes Sense!


**One more thing.** Many of our best customers are relying on out-sourcers to put people to work under their own roofs. That means our customers' own employees are getting to work on time, but they're still witnessing employee scheduling performed the old-fashioned, grueling and inefficient way.


**If your provider is sending you confused and bleary-eyed workers, let us know!** We'll get them onto the right path with efficient, internet and remote staff scheduling software - **and we'll reward you for the tip.**
