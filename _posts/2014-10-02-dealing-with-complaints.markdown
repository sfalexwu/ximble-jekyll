When working with people, you might receive complaints from time to time despite your best efforts to meet clients' expectations. Dealing with upset or even angry customers should be taken as a challenge, the constructive one, which will help you improve your products or services. You should keep in mind that the unsatisfied customer always has two choices: 1. to complain to you or 2. to leave and switch to your competitors without saying a word. The way you deal with this situation will determine whether or not your deserve this customer's loyalty. 

1. First and foremost, you should be calm and relaxed when dealing with a complaint at the same time providing assurance to the customer that the issue will be resolved. You should speak in a friendly, helpful manner.

2. It is vital that you do not lose your temper and that you do not argue. Under no condition, do not let to be involved in an argument. If you see that you are losing control over the situation, the best idea would be to involve someone else, which usually makes the situation less tense.

3. Let the customer explain their problem and do not interrupt them until they have finished. If they are frustrated, let them talk until they have released their anger. At the same time, listen carefully and try to get as many facts and details as you can.

4. If you have any questions, ask them in a caring manner. Be sympathetic and use attentive listening techniques. Showing to the customer that you understand the problem and that you are willing to resolve it will defuse a potentially escalating situation.

5. Apologize for the inconvenience and do not waste time either on defending your company or blaming someone else. Never make excuses. Instead, offer to investigate the problem. 

6. Ask the person what they think the answer is. Becoming a partner with a complaining customer in resolving an issue is a great approach when dealing with complaints.

7. Explain what you are going to do about the problem. Make sure that you do it and once you have resolved the problem, let the customer know about that.

Have in mind that gaining a new customer is much more expensive than keeping an existing one. Hence, addressing and solving the issue the complaining customer has brought to your attention should be your top priority.
