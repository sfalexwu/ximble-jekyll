Quite often, while creating the weekly or monthly schedule, the manager or administrator knows in advance which shifts need to be covered. However, which employee would be the best fit and who will be available that far ahead may or may not be known. The concept behind our “Open Shifts” functionality is that HR managers have a stack of pre-defined shifts that may be re-assigned to employees later on through one of many available methods.

Creating an open shift is not so different from creating any other shift that you plan to assign to an employee straight away. Instead of clicking on the row where you see your employee’s name on the weekly schedule, you can just click on the first row next to the “Open Shifts” label and create a shift without assigning it to a specific employee.

When you create an open shift, you can leave it unassigned until you make a decision to whom it will be assigned, or you can leave it for your employees to apply to pick-up that shift on their own. If you decide to allow your employees to pick-up available open shifts, then only the ones whose position and department match the data set for the open shift will be eligible to apply to pick-up.

As for employees, they’ll have two ways to pick up available open shifts that match their job role defined in the system (position/department combination).

• **Applying to pick-up Open Shifts from the schedule page**

From the “My Schedule” page, an employee can click on the “Open Shifts” button above the schedule and view all available open shifts for his job role in the system for that specific week. In order to apply for any available open shift in the system, an employee can simply click on the “Pick-up” button and that’s it.

• **Applying to pick-up Open Shifts from the Requests section**

In case an employee would like to cover a wider range of Open Shifts, instead of having to go week by week to see available open shifts, the “Shifts available for Pick-up” page is the right place for him. Once an employee clicks on the “Requests” section, “Shifts available for Pick-up” will be available on the menu on the left. From there, applying to pick-up an open shift is quite easy and requires an employee to simply click on the “Pick-up” link next to each available open shift.

Of course, the manager will always have the final say. All such open shift pick-up requests will come to the manager for an approval who’ll be able to see all employees that applied to pick-up each shift and make a decision on which request should be approved and which rejected. In case there’s more than one employee applying to pick-up an open shift, the manager will have a chance to select the preferred one.
