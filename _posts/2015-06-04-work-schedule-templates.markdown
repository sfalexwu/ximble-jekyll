Re-creating the same set of shifts from week to week is certainly no fun for any manager or supervisor. Particularly if they manage a larger team of employees, this process could waste so many hours of their precious time. This is why our experts invested their time and effort to find easy ways for creating repetitive work schedules. One of those solutions provided by our employee scheduling software is Schedule Template management.

A schedule template, plain and simple, is a saved schedule for your team on a certain location for a specific period of time. You can save a schedule as a template for just one day, a couple of days, a week, or a full month. The choice is yours.

Once you name your schedule template the way you like and select a date range, you can choose whether you want to save all those shifts with or without your employees' names.

**Saving the template with employees**

This option will simply allow you to save the schedule as you see it. All your shifts will stay assigned to the same employees on the template as well. Once you decide to re-apply the template, the same employees will be automatically assigned with the same set of shifts.

**Saving the template without employees**

In case you want to save all the shifts you have on the schedule, but you think those shifts may be assigned to different employees, then you can use this option. This functionality allows you to save time on creating repetitive shifts that do not necessarily need to be assigned to the same employees in the future.

As soon as you save the template, you will see it in the “Schedule template” section in the sub-menu. You can click on your template, and edit it on the fly. So, the next time when you re-apply your template, all the changes you have made will be applied as well.

Applying a schedule template is even easier than saving it. You just find the week when you wish to re-apply your template, click on the Tools above the schedule and select “Apply template” from the list of options. There, you simply select your template, optionally re-adjust the date range when you wish to start applying your template and click the “Apply” button.

**Enforce availability and schedule limits**

In case you would like the system to follow your employees’ availability set that perhaps changed in the meantime between creating the template and applying it, you can enable “Enforce availability and schedule limits”, which will simply send all those shifts that were supposed to be applied to certain employees who are no longer available to the Open Shifts area.
