Knowing who you're going to need and when is as important as knowing how much of inventory you're going to need.

It's all happening at the same, and very often, we talk to clients who spend no time on managing schedules, and have to blame employees when things don't go well.

Over-staffing leads to a waste of money but under-staffing loses you customer and sales. Being able to anticipate demand including labor demand is the name of the game in today's competitive retail environment.

Scheduling breaks automatically and ensuring proper coverage at all times is increasingly left to automated systems that more accurately reflect both the needs and wishes of employees and cover the basics of your operation. For stores and chains with multiple outlets and sales environments, the retail schedules that work are those that are carefully constructed around a given set of rules, and the filled in by the employees themselves.


## Retail Schedules that Work as Hard as You Do




### 6 Points to Consider When Automating Your Retail Scheduling Process




**1. Tracking and calibrating specific employee skills** is not only important, it's vital to your overall work scheduling process. Openers, closers and floor managers, among other important roles make your operation smarter, and your scheduling should reflect that. The more of these key roles that can be spelled out, the quicker and better you get qualified people working in every area.

**2. Getting control over promotions** and other event based tasks that come down from "on high" also needs to be a big part of your scheduling management. How you manage all the tasks necessary for a seasonal event or special should give you a good idea of how to handle any event.




**3. Managers need the tools to see that every task is executed across stores and in real time** and that sales or floor staff are occupied during non-peak hours. The better the communication between branches and headquarters, the better the trackable data that can improve the entire operation.




**4. Don't forget.** The ability to quickly cover unplanned absences with qualified personnel is vital, and comes up again and again. Qualified personnel actually appreciate the opportunity and the trust you place in them.




**5.Operations data helps all managers** to make more accurate decisions about who and how and where. Analyze all of it and work with a specialist if you're not sure what you're seeing. Managing on the fly often requires more mobile decisions and real-time date. Work with it.




**6. Freedom for employees** can mean more choice, more flexibility and more irregular schedules. But that can all translate into happier more productive employees and better numbers all the way around.


How you manage is up to you. We're here to help, but these six points should be a good start for getting the process moving in the right direction.
