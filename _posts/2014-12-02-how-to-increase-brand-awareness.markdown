How to create better brand awareness within your targeted market? Are there any useful tips and tricks that can save us money and provide a better outcome? Let’s take a look at some of the most efficient ways to increase brand awareness:

**Create sharable content.** Give your target audience a reason to share your opinions and thoughts and do your marketing job for you. With an increase of social media network users, this step may become a very important one for your business. Creating an effective title for your content and some valuable tips for the industry may prove valuable to your audience reach.

**Add a personal touch to your business awareness.** Your customers should see that you are not a corporate robot and that you do have an intriguing personality. Staying within the professional boundaries, feel free to experiment with your approach to market and your audience and do not be afraid to step out with honest opinions and bring some personality to the table.

**Provide excellent customer support.** The most important thing after the product’s price and quality is the customer service. Your clients or prospects may have some questions about the product or service you offer and their first impression of your customer service may set a ground for their overall impression of your company.

**Read and listen through social media, don’t just post.** Take some time to carefully read comments and posts made by your current group fans or your competitors. Posting quality content is important, but reading what others say about your business and about your competitors' strengths and weaknesses could greatly benefit for your approach.

**Stay in touch with the market.** Although creating a brand name is important, maintaining a contact with your target audience is of equal importance as well. Stay in touch with your clients and prospects by occasionally [sending them a newsletter](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/email-marketing/), [social media](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/) post or any other means of communication just to remind them you are still here, or else you might get forgotten. 

**Write blog articles with valuable content.** Spoil your audience by providing them with valuable articles about what they want to know or learn. Turn your occasional website visitors into followers and try to deliver the content on a regular basis. Although some of them may not be your actual customers, you would like to help them associate you with your industry niche. This is valuable on multiple levels.

**Use the same logo on all fronts.** In order to make your brand recognizable, create an effective logo and use it in all fields of your interaction with prospects and clients, including social media, blog articles, etc. Even if you have an excellent graphics designer on hand, who can create 10 stunning logos for your brand, try to choose one and stick to it.

**Present your team to your customers and visitors.** It is not a secret that people frequently have a hard time trusting certain information on the Internet and on various websites. By presenting your team, or at least your management team, you are showing to your website visitors and/or prospects who you are and why they can trust you. Make sure to add some personal information about each member of your team. Help your prospects gain trust in your company and they will convert into loyal clients.
