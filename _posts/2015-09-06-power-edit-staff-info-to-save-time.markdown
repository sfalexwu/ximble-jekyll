Managing a group of employees and balancing their skills and expertise when it comes to tasks can be an extremely complex process. If anything else pops up to that equation, it can cause the manager or supervisor of the team to lose his precious time on sorting out administrative info. When using any kind of cloud system, no matter if it's an HR, Scheduling, Time Tracking or Payroll, making changes to your employee profiles can take substantial amount of time. Right? Well, not with NimbleSchedule!

Making some small adjustments to individual employee profiles is just fine. You just open their profile, navigate to the option you need to change, make the actual change and save the page. Pretty simple and straightforward. However, what happens when you need to alter profiles for 50, 100 or even more employees at the same time? It would be a complete waste of time if you would have to go one profile at a time to make necessary changes, wouldn't it? This is where our team implemented the so called **“Power Edit”** option which allows you to make mass profile changes/updates on a single page.

As you can see on the screenshot above, you can easily select a group of employees or even all your employees along with a piece of info you need to mass update for everyone. For example, if you need to enable a single type of notification for all your staff members, that’s a 10-second task with Power Edit. By selecting all employees and the “Schedule published” notification, you’ll be able to edit the setting for that notification for all your employees at once.

While selecting the type of update you wish to make, you’ll be able to select either an “Individual” or “Group” change. The “Group” change will simply provide you with a single field which you can select or fill in and apply to everyone. With the “Individual” type of update, you’ll get each of your employees listed along with the field next to their name to update or edit. While this may be a bit more time consuming when compared to the “Group” change, it can be useful when you need to make a change for a group of your employees but that change is not the same for all of them. At the same time, editing certain info from a single page should still save you a lot of time because you do not have to click on each of your employee profiles, navigate back and forth and save all that data. With “Power Edit”, you’ll be done in no time!
