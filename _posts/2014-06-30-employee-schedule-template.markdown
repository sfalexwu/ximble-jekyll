## The Employee Schedule Template




## to Beat All Templates!


Summer can bring all kinds of highs and lows to all kinds of businesses.

Getting yours in shape now means more than just downloading a scheduling template and filling it in.

Working with a serious human capital management system has become an absolute necessity for anyone managing more than a small handful of employees.

Busier seasons are also an excellent time to see and distinguish between those people really being productive and contributing to the organization, and those who aren't.

So **optimizing your labor spend** means [knowing who the most productive and reliable people are](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/reduce-scheduling-errors/) - and scheduling them for the hours when they're needed.

**It also means - cross-training.**

That is, some of your most important functions are going to require a star-player from a lower level, or even from elsewhere in the organization, to step up and be ready to shine.

No old-school employee scheduling template is going to help you to do that.

Summer is like that. Guess what?

Those same star players are going to want a break - some of them at the worst possible moment.


## Labor Cost Control That Makes Sense


Unfortunately, most businesses look at the whole question backwards. Keep everyone struggling and working the minimum possible hours and then hopefully you'll scrape by.

But maybe deadbeat employees get the jobs - and the deadbeat bosses - that they deserve.

Don't be one of them.

Rigorous attention to employee scheduling, and not just a template means working with a comprehensive human capital management system.

**Staying on top of high performing people means letting them go! **
But first you've got to know who they are. Maximum productivity means putting the best people where their skills are best used and most valuable. It also lets you keep the overtime to exactly what's necessary and nothing more - even for the people who want and depend on it.

Labor compliance used to be a nightmare. And it still is for some employers. But smart bosses know that the systems they put in place can easily manage - and even optimize - workplace schedules and workers so that everyone is happy.


## Get a Life


Better managed schedules mean self-managed schedules, and with your entire crew showing up just when they're needed and just when they want to be there - you get a crew that is far more productive. It's also saving you loads of money. Logging vacation or personal days is easy, and it's almost as rewarding as working someplace that let's you do it!!!

Remember, none of this is about so-called "Just-in-Time" scheduling.

On the contrary, using a proper Human Capital Management system, like NimbleSchedule integrated with the [Partner Integrations](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/partner-integrations/) we're pleased to offer, you get schedules that let your employees plan, and plan to stay with you.

There's no better talent retention system, (or turn-over reduction plan for that matter) than a plan to give your employees their lives back. Their families, communities and your business will be better for it.
