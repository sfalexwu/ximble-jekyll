# Launching your employee schedule calendar into the cloud is a breath of fresh air - for you and your work team!




Your employee schedule calendar is just like every part of your business software and computer infrastructure. Slowly but surely, more and more of it is lifting off from local hard drives and servers and settling up in the cloud.




Improved security measures, contractual guarantees and access that simply couldn't be delivered locally make it all the more likely that an increasing part of your data will settle in the cloud too.




As businesses struggle with changing needs, technologies and workforces, all of them face an increasing pressure to adapt to the new business environment. But it's not something you need to dread.




In fact, you may find that your business can adapt quickly and profit mightily from a few simple cloud-based innovations coming down the pike...





# The Cloud Hosted Employee Calendar




**NimbleSchedule**'s cloud employee schedule calendar is designed to make scheduling even highly complex work schedules and shift schedules easy. But ease of use is just the beginning of the benefits you'll enjoy.




**NimbleSchedule allows for far greater flexibility in all of your employee scheduling.** So much so that shift schedulers and managers don't need to monitor individual employee shifts. Instead, they set initial rules and can allow for far greater voluntary shift scheduling. Suddenly every shift and position is covered, while employees schedule time on or off the clock in a way that's more comfortable for them.




Happier employees feel they're gaining increasing respect from a company that's easily able to accommodate their personal lives and balance everyone's complex scheduling needs.




Because **NimbleSchedule** requires no roll-out, and integrates easily with standing systems, your managers are up and running in just a day or so.




You end up with a much happier workforce, even though you're spending far less time micromanaging individual employees' schedules.




Because it's in the cloud, employees check in from where ever they happen to be. So it's the perfect solution for remote workforces and for business with multiple overlapping shift workers.




Managers can be alerted to problems or to conflicts only when they come up and can set increasingly complex rules - only as they need to. Minimum and maximum work weeks goals are easily met without the necessity for expensive over-time.





# This Cloud is Nothing but Silver Lining.




Your new cloud based employee scheduling calendar lets every employee check in remotely, by smart phone, text or email. **NimbleSchedule** even integrates easily with Google Calendar or even Facebook events calendar. Employees get the advantage of increased flexibility, and you get anytime, anywhere access to the data that keeps your employees in the best shape for your business. Alerts go out - only to those who need them - and under-staffing of any given shift can easily reach workers who are much more enthusiastic about showing up, or covering a last-minute dropped shift.




**NimbleSchedule** is probably not the first cloud-based service your company will take advantage of. Almost certainly it won't be the last. One more big advantage you'll experience is that **NimbleSchedule** regularly provides system updates, database tuning, backups, reporting functionality and service improvements that keep your manager focused on the task at hand rather than on software difficulties.




Say goodbye to complex paper-based scheduling and bulletin board postings. No matter the size or scale of your current enterprise, **NimbleSchedule** is designed to scale with your business. As your better able to determine which team members are helping your business to grow, your also better able to grow as a business.




**That's something to make all of us smile, even on the very cloudiest of days.**
