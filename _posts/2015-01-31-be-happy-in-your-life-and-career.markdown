Achieving an adequate level of happiness in your life and career is challenging on many levels. Although this might be a goal that many people share, their perception of the right level of happiness in career and in personal life vary. With that being said, it is obvious that there is no universal recipe on how to achieve happiness in life; however, there are certainly some pointers and questions you need to ask yourself in order to determine the right measures for yourself.

[![Achieve Happiness in Life](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/happiness-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/happiness.jpg)

The first step in this process is achieving full awareness of what makes you happy and how you perceive your work as well as your personal life goals. What are those major or small things in your life that make you happy? What other things or people do you need to include in order o make some of those events and occasions more pleasant for you?Are you hitting all the marks you have set for yourself at your job and what are your long term goals?

When you have a clear vision about your career desires and the goals you have set for yourself, it is time to proceed to the analysis of the current situation. Are you on the right path to achieve your career goals and do you have enough time to achieve the right level of happiness and satisfaction in your personal life? If your answer is “No”, then you might need to set some better boundaries. If you spend too much time at work, which prevents you from having a fulfilling personal life with your spouse, kids or friends, then you certainly need to take some steps to ensure to [achieve the work-life balance](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/achieving-the-work-life-balance/).

If you start noticing that your work life interferes too much into your personal time which you are supposed to dedicate to your family or friends, start enforcing those boundaries and actively work on preventing that from happening again. The same goes the other way around. If you have too many distractions during your work hours coming from your friends or the beloved ones, then work on [ways to increase your productivity](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-productivity/) and get yourself back on track as soon as possible. 

While money can be a great motivator, especially in companies that financially reward their employees for achieving better results and pay for every minute of overtime, one should not be focused only on money. Some people call it greed whereas some others consider it reasonable economic behavior, but what should be agreed on is that that one should seek for more things in his lives than just money. A healthy relationship with money is a key factor in determining the right amount of hours you wish to dedicate to your work. If you find yourself burning the midnight oil too often, you might want to ask yourself if it is worth it.

On the other hand, happiness in life is not something that will come by itself. Actively working on important parts of your life and cultivating things that make you happy should be your constant activities. If you must dedicate a lot of hours to your work, try scheduling some relaxing events whenever possible. Watching a movie with your friend or going to the theater with your spouse might be just the right thing you need for the day to make you happy.

Recognizing the things that drain your energy is an important step as well. By stepping away from such habits or behaviors you could achieve a much better balance in your life and have enough time and energy for other things, both work or non-work related ones. [Delegating some of your duties](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/) to of your colleagues or employees might give you some room for your personal life or other work assignments.

Last, but not least, is certainly the circle of people that surrounds you. This goes for both your working and private life environment. Surround yourself with successful, hard working people that appreciate the right values and similar things like you do. Be in company of your friends and your loved ones as much as possible and, eventually, you will achieve the needed inner happiness.
