## Employee Absenteeism costs U.S. Businesses Billions.




## Is it costing yours?


Every year employee absenteeism costs American businesses - literally - billions of dollars. Those costs are not just for lost productivity. Even the cost of keeping track of when employees are showing up - and when they're notÂ  - adds up to a tremendous amount of money - and that's year upon year.

In larger organizations, every single manager accountable for the schedules of more than 1 employee is losing somewhere between one and two hours every week - just on scheduling and making up for absences, dropped shifts, missed shifts and sick-days.

In larger industries, one business alone can easily be losing over ten million dollars annually because they're scheduling is not flexible and not easy enough to use - by everyone.


### How flexible does Flexible Scheduling have to be?


The top reasons that employees call in sick when they aren't actually sick are stress and a sense of being overworked.

**Yet most managers still feel - and perhaps rightly - that they simply cannot give every employee the flexibility to simply show up when they feel like it.**

Flexible scheduling - while it will dramatically improve employee absenteeism - does not necessarily mean flex-time for everybody.

Improving engagement and productivity, including that of scheduling managers is the name of the game. But "show up when you feel like it" is not what it's all about.

Most **NimbleSchedule** users have set custom rules that allow increasing levels of flexibility based on job title, skills, seniority and other factors. Lower-level employees still enjoy the ability to add or drop shifts via email, internet or even text message. That ability alone saves every business we work with the time it would take to reconfigure a schedule.

Clocking in by cell phone, internet or tablet also gives a much clearer picture of what's going on. Scheduling managers can work with a clear and accurate picture, and still allow greater freedom to every level of employee.

And **NimbleSchedule**'s reporting features allow you to instantly analyze trends or absenteeism rates so that you know the difference between a real problem, and someone who just needs a bit more freedom.

Those much more self-scheduled employees now enjoy a far greater sense of control over their work lives. Because you set the rules, employees will much more willingly adjust to the rules with their own schedules, which are suddenly much more accommodating. Just knowing that you can easily have four hours for your own professional appointments during a regular work week makes life a lot easier. It also makes employees see that they've got a responsive, understanding manager looking after them.

Managers are spending more time on creating and encouraging engagement rather than on administering time schedules, and employees are enjoying a far greater sense of freedom and control over their work-life balance.
