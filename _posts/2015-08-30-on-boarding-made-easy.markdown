No matter if you are moving from another cloud employee scheduling software to NimbleSchedule or if you never used a SaaS system to manage your employees and schedule, our intuitive on-boarding tools and features will make this process super easy for you. 

If you manage a team of at least 5-10 employees, then chances are pretty high that you have all their info on file in some list. In case you've used excel until now to manage your employees’ work schedule, you are half way done with creating a schedule in our system. All you need to do is to slightly adjust that excel list to the format that our system accepts, and your schedule can be up in the cloud in our schedule maker in no time.



#### Importing an Employee List via CSV/Excel



No matter if you have your employees’ list on a comma separated list (CSV) or in an Excel file, you can import it into our system in a matter of seconds. Just click on the Employees tab when logged in to the system and from sub-menu options, click on the “Import Employees” option. Once you do that, the system will prompt you to select the employees’ file list from your computer and to specify the columns in your file.

#### Importing a Schedule From a CSV/Excel List



In case you already have a pre-determined schedule for your team, or if you perhaps used another scheduling system in the past which allowed you to export your data in a CSV or Excel file format, then you can easily import that into our system. With just a couple of clicks of your mouse, and by mapping your file data columns with the exact data type in our system, you can have your schedule fully imported and operational in a matter of minutes.
