In order to make our time tracking software more flexible for employee’ records management, our engineering team implemented a new feature called “Mass Editing” into our staff management system. This new mass editing feature allows streamlined management of a large amount of records in an easy to use procedure and it simplifies the use of our web based time tracking software. If you’re already our client, then you’re probably aware of our “Approve All” feature which allows mass approval of employee time tracking records in our system. On top of that feature, we now have a whole set of fields that can be mass edited or altered.

Once you visit the “Timesheets” page, on the far right of each timesheet record, you’ll notice a new check-box displayed. Above the list, and below the “Approve All” button, you’ll notice two new buttons that allow you to mass select or edit selected records. Aside from using the mass select feature, you can also use those check-boxes to manually select the exact records you wish to edit. Within the mass selection menu, you’ll have a chance to select:

• All – Allows you to automatically select all records shown on the page
• None – Allows you to automatically deselect all the selected records
• Approved – Allows you to select all approved records on the page
• Un-Approved – Allows you to select all approval-pending records on the page

Once you’ve selected records that you wish to mass edit, you can proceed by clicking on the pencil/edit icon next to the mass selection tool. As soon as you click on that icon, a popup will show up and it will present you with some options that will help you edit the selected timesheets. The fields you’ll have a chance to mass edit are:

• Job Code
• Approval status
• Position
• Department
• Location

You can skip any of the fields you wish to leave unchanged and select those you wish to alter. When you select the desired change from the drop down menus, click the “Update” button and that’s it. All records you’ve previously selected will be adjusted.

There’s no need for manual editing of one record at a time anymore. You can easily select a whole group of records through our time tracking software and commit a change through a single popup dialog. A piece of cake, right? 

Stay tuned for more great updates!
