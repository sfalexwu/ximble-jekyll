Video interviews are becoming more and more popular among job interviewers. With the advancement of technology a lot of people are nowadays being interviewed  online with a camera switched on. The video component adds some complexity that was not present with phone or voice-only online interviews.

In order to _master your video interviewing techniques_, here are some tips and tricks that may help you ace your next online job conversation.

**Dress appropriately.** Even though you are at home and in your everyday environment, that’s certainly not the reason to treat an online video interview differently. Unless you are applying for a position of a fashion designer, your potential employer will not be interested in your clothing taste, but remember: a professional look with a buttoned up shirt can set the professional first impression with the interviewer. 

**Be cognizant of the background.** Someone may find that a bit silly, but a messy office or room can suggest to the employer that you are not a well-organized person since you work in such an untidy environment. Again, this is not the reason why someone may or may not hire you, but remember that you have just one chance to make the first impression. Clean up your room or office and make sure that everything that your web camera catches as the background looks well organized and as professional as possible. 

**Find the goldilocks position for your web camera.** You probably don’t want your camera to be too far away from your face, but you certainly don’t want it to be too close either. Find the best angle and position where you can place your camera. Test it out a couple of times prior to the meeting and determine the best way to position the webcam. 

**Pay attention to all light sources.** Keep in mind that by appearing in a dark environment with not enough light may be perceived in a negative way by your interviewer. Make sure that the room from which you intend to do your interview has enough light, and if needed, point an extra desk lamp in your direction.

**Test the video conference platform before the meeting.** In case you are already invited, then you should be aware of the exact platform where that meeting will be held. Quite frequently that’s either Skype or Google Hangout, but sometimes it may be some different software, like Join.me  or RingCentral. Make sure that you test it properly prior to your actual meeting just to make sure that from the technical standpoint everything works fine. This includes the video component, your headphones, microphone and/or speakers. If your friends tell you that your voice sounds a bit muffled during the call via Skype, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t consider a slightly better internet connection speed or even a different headphones set. 

**Shine in the interview!** Practice a couple of times for that meeting and make sure you have all the questions and answers ready. While practicing you may even record yourself and analyze that recording afterwards in order to improve. Make sure you don’t make any facial gestures while answering certain questions, since the camera is always on you during the job interview. Try to sound positive and optimistic in order to increase your chances.
