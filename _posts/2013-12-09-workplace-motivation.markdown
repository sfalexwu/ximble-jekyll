## Workplace Motivation in Ten Easy Steps


_

Workplace motivation is not just about getting more out of people for less time and the same money.

It's also about engagement, getting better productivity, higher interest and more happiness. You end up with people who better represent your company and who better reinforce your company mission, values and who ultimately make yours into a more profitable and efficient enterprise.

Do these Ten Things and you'll see better results from your entire enterprise.


### 1) Clarify Your (Company) Values


Ramp up your internal communications so that your people are continually learning, from you, and from the organization as whole. We put this one first because it's so important. Be clear. Work with a good editor to continually revise and restate the company positions and values.


### 2) Listen


These steps are going to get simpler, but let's start with the most important. Be clear in what you say - and EVEN CLEARER in your listening. If you haven't worked on your company values, then start listening and listening good. Then write down your values based on what you learned. Make sure something about listening is in there. Make sure everyone in any kind of leadership position is listening and is approachable and communicates that they are ready to listen.


### 3) Eliminate Prejudice


This should be part of your values statement anyway, but we're not necessarily talking about overt racism or discrimination. Far more important is prejudice in your performance evaluations and personal impressions. Treat people fairly even if you don't like them and push for more openness and inclusiveness.


### 4) Eliminate Pettiness


Forgiveness is great. Practice it and promote work life balance. Don't let small issues of lateness or too much time off interfere with your evaluations of your best people. Forget about small infractions and talk about work life.


### 5) Set Goals


But more important, talk about them. Oh. And we're not talking about company wide or departmental goals. Work with employees company-wide and talk about THEIR GOALS. Institutionalize the practice. Reward achievement.  See below...


### 6) Recognize Greatness


Getting to work on time and having a successful day is terrific. Doing that and raising three kids is outstanding. Recognize and talk about all of the things that all of your people are doing. See #2 above. Listen, then communicate.


### 7) Recognize More People Everyday


Again, put this one in your values statement. Learn more people's names. Understand more of what they do. And make sure your leadership people are doing the same thing.


### 8) Appreciate the Finer Things


Leadership can be measured in every aspect of your office experience. It can be measured outside the office and in your peoples' jobs and in their lives. People are not coming to your company everyday for what you want. They've come for what they want. Make more of it. Celebrate them and give them more.


### 9) Don't Avoid the Issues (any Issues)


Problems have a way of festering, growing and multiplying. If there are attitudes that need adjusting, get someone in there quick to adjust them. If they're problems in your leadership then they are probably worse than you think. Tackle them and cut the worst offenders off and show them to the door.


### 10) Practice Humility


Maybe it sounds very Zen. Most working people will consider it an act of humility if the CEO simply learns their name and says hello to them. Learn what they do, take an interest in any and all of it. All of that is humility. Do we need to say? Get it into your company values statement and get it right. Practice it. Make it real. Then you'll be motivating others and making money.

Practice all of the above starting today. Getting people moving means getting yourself moving. It does mean practicing what you are preaching too. But after all is said and done, it's also a lot easier than what it sounds too.
