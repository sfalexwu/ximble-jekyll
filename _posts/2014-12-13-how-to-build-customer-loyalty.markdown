We all know that nowadays getting new customers is very hard whereas maintaining the existing ones should be an easier task. Some studies show that maintaining a good relationship with your returning clients is a lot cheaper than gaining new ones. With some industry niches, returning customers can generate more than 80% of sales, so going an extra mile to invoke customer loyalty may pay off in the long run.

For that reason, we have selected some of the most useful tips for creating customer loyalty: 

**Communicate with your customers as often as possible.** Sending an email to customers, or communicating with them through social media or any other means of communication can make them feel appreciated by your company. This type of communication doesn’t necessarily need to be an advertisement each time. You should always try to add some value to your communication with customers by providing them with some interesting information, discount coupons or notification about a new product.

**Good customer service could be the key to your success.** Some studies show that besides the product quality, customers recognize good customer service as the next best thing to have. By having a team of polite and friendly workers covering your customer support needs, you can significantly improve the first impression about your company or your products. With that being said, your support members need to be well trained and knowledgeable about your product or service and address customers' issues or questions quickly and efficiently. 

**Try to make your communication with clients sound personal.** If a customer name is available to you or your support team, then always use it when communicating with them. No matter if that communication is in the form of an email, text message or personal meeting, always address your customers by their name.

**Offer incentives to your returning customers.** It doesn’t matter what type of a program you decide to apply because incentives can actually make your customers return to your company and buy another product or use another service. Depending on your industry niche, you can use gift cards, offer the buy one – get two free deal or other similar types of programs thus creating customer loyalty . 

**Let your returning customers skip the line.** No matter if you are in the retail or IT business, let your loyal and returning customers have a special treatment and a possibility to skip the line when it comes to certain requests or purchases. Make them feel special and appreciated and, in return, you will get a loyal customer, ready to come back for more or even ready to recommend your business to others. As mentioned in one of our previous articles, [the word of mouth](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/the-word-of-mouth/) can be one of the best marketing tactics, the one that doesn’t cost even close to some other methods.

**Insist on reliability within your company.** When you give out promises to customers, make sure you fulfill them. By building a reputation of being reliable, you will show to your clients that your word means something and that they can always rely on you. 

**Provide your loyal customers with an advanced insight into your business.** If you operate a manufacturing business, allow a group of your loyal customers to visit your production line and see how their favorite products are being made. In case you run a restaurant, have the chef come out once in a while and have a small chat with your returning clients about the meal they just had. They will appreciate the opportunity of being able to speak with the person who just created that delightful meal for them.

After reading this article we are sure you already have some ideas of your own regarding creating customer loyalty. All in all,  be creative and tie your customers to your brand.
