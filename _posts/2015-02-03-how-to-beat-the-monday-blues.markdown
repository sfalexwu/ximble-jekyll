So, it’s Monday morning and you are about to go to work. One more eventful weekend is over and you are contemplating on how to beat the Monday blues. If you were smart and lucky enough, you used the opportunity to relax from work and you spent some quality time with your friends or family. If you are more of a loner, you probably watched TV, ordered some pizza or played a game or two on your computer. Alas, that lovely weekend is completely over now.

If you are a workaholic, then Monday morning is probably a great time for you. A new work week is starting and here comes your new chance to prove yourself at work. Your ironed suit and polished shoes are probably already waiting for you along with the reports meticulously packed in your briefcase.

As for the rest of the world, well, it seems they need a small kick-start at the beginning of the week. A big cup of coffee and some nice music on the way to work might do the trick. For those that need a bit of more of an inspiration here is one amazing motivational video to set your mood for the whole week.



As H. Jackson Brown, Jr once said: _“Find a job you like and you will add five days to every week”_. So the question is, do you have a job you like? If the answer is “Yes”, then you are a lucky person. Not everyone has that luck to do what they love. But even then, it is nice to remind yourself of the things you have and the goals you have set for yourself.

If you had a tough last week at work, this is a great chance to re-start. Hopefully, the rest you had during the weekend recharged your batteries and you are a new person now. In case you were among those who did not use the weekend in this manner, then this is the last moment to prepare your mind and body for a successful work week. Keep your chin up, put a smile on that face and energetically shout _“Good morning to everyone!”_ once you enter your office.

Find the key points of your job that you like and focus on them. Focusing too much on the things that stress you out will not bring any good. If there are some problems you cannot resolve on your own, ask your boss or colleagues for their opinion or help. Attack your duties straight away and get yourself in the work mood. Keep in mind what Aristotle once said: _“Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work”_. Focus on the good stuff.

Use your talents in the best possible way and improve yourself constantly. Every person has something to bring to the table and there is a seed of greatness in each one of us. If your current job is not the one that inspires you, then look at the positive sides of it for now. Let your high income be a comforting aspect for the time being and be patient - no one knows what the new week might bring.

For those Hollywood fans among us, just remember Sean Connery’s words: _“There is nothing like a challenge to bring out the best in man”_. Are you ready to do your best this week?
