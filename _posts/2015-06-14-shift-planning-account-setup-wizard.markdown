Getting started with any kind of software usually represents a challenge to a new user, no matter how much experience that user has with computer/internet usage in general. Familiarizing with some of the features and functionalities of newly obtained software could sometimes take a lot of time and patience. This is why our experts and engineers have created an intro setup wizard that will help you configure some of the basic steps for the use of our shift planning system.

The first thing you will see once you register with NimbleSchedule and confirm your email address is the intro tutorial video which will give you a quick overview of some of the basic functionalities of our cloud schedule builder. When you finish watching the video, you'll get to our setup wizard. There are 5 steps covered in this wizard and by completing those steps you will have some of the basic stuff ready to start using our web scheduler.


### Step 1 – Departments


[![Shift Planning Setup Wizard - Step 1](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step1-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step1.jpg)In this first step of our setup wizard you will get just one question to answer with Yes or No, and you will have a choice to select whether or not you wish to group your employees per department or not. In case you are not sure, you can always change your answer through the software later on, so don’t worry if you decide just to skip that step and proceed to the next one. If you decide to answer with a “Yes”, then you will be presented with an option to create your departments at this point.


### Step 2 – Positions

Again, in case you do not have the full list already prepared, you can start by adding just a couple of positions to get you started and afterwards you will be able to add more positions or make any changes to the existing ones.


### Step 3 – Locations

**• Timezone – You will be able to configure your default timezone for your company as well as for your personal user profile through this field. In case you have employees across multiple timezones, don’t worry - they will have a chance to configure their own timezone setting later on through their profiles.**
**• Location name – By default our system will simply create a location name for your employees by using your company name and adding the “HQ” at the end. Optionally, you can rename this default location and name it the way you wish.**
**• Additional locations – The last section on this page will allow you to create additional locations for your company account. In case all your employees work in a single location or you simply do not need to use multiple locations, then you can leave those fields empty and you’ll get to use just your default location.**




### Step 4 – Employees

If you have such data in an excel or a CSV file, then you can simply use the “Choose file” button and import your employee list. Once you have either manually entered your employee names or imported your employee list, you can click on “I’m done” to exit the wizard.
