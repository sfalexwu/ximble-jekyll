There are many reasons why sometimes an employee just doesn’t fit into the team or shows poor performance in assigned tasks. Of course, there are employees who perform quite well, but after a while they become tired of their job or they receive a better offer from another company and they decide to leave. No matter what the reason might be, the work history and time tracking records should be kept in the archive.

Keeping the complete work history of all the shifts and time records for those employees who end up leaving your company, either on their own or after being fired, can be both time and resource consuming and, ultimately, it leads to unnecessary expenses. Quite often when an employee gets fired or leaves a company on bad terms, he may start some legal or procedural actions which will require a company in question to prove either the shift history or the time punches or wages paid to the employee. Easy access to such data may be crucial in cases like that.

With NimbleSchedule, when an employee leaves or gets fired, the history remains - indefinitely. We will never clear your data from our system as long as you are a client of ours. With that said, all you need to do when someone leaves your company, willingly or not, is to “terminate” their account in our system and that’s it. By terminating or, put in other words, by suspending their account to NimbleSchedule, you get to keep the complete history of shifts, requests, time clock punches and payroll reports for such an employee. Accessing such data whenever you need it is simple and easy and you can do it at any moment. No matter what kind of info you need from the system, you can retrieve it by using an employee’s name and a date range - the same you would do for an active employee in the system.

To sweeten the deal as much as possible, we won’t even charge you for terminated/suspended employee accounts. Namely, when your employee leaves the company, even for a couple of months, you can suspend their access to the system while keeping the complete work history. Why would you pay for accounts that are not being used? You pay just for what you need! That’s our policy.

In an effort to make life simpler and easier to business owners and company managers, our engineering team continues to develop ways to help companies on their paths of success.
