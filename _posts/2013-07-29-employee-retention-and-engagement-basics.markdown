## 8 Tips




### for Building Employee Retention and Engagement Basics from the Ground Up


___

**Let's run with it. Employee retention and engagement strategies come and go.** So do employees.

If you're ready to get serious then take this - all of it - into consideration, and start putting as much into play in your workplace as you can. You'll see the rewards in longer employee relationships and more meaningful work.


### 1) It’s just not about the money.


Very few people get married for the money. Very few. Likewise, people accept jobs because they think they can do them and they think they can do them well. Workers expect their raises to be modest. But like their marriages, people's jobs are measured in terms of comradery, security, and future growth.


### 2) Every Employee Is Different


No one has a homogeneous work force. Every work force is made up of people from crazy different backgrounds, educations and experiences. Understanding how to meet their needs and expectations — is a terrific way to learn to better put them to work.


### 3) Expectations need to be Managed, Just Like Workers


Specific goals and benchmarks, written down, and posted, will make a world of difference. Any plan of action is better than none at all. Make an effort at transparency and let your teams no what's in it for them.


### 4) Act the Part!


Management doesn't just need to look the part but to act it, all the time. Just like you can't show up for work drunk, you can't show up distracted, lazy, or listless. Your full engagement does wonders to inspire engagement in your team. Leadership is a 24 hour job.


### 5) Keep Your Word - and Give It, Often.


If you can't keep your promises - DON'T MAKE THEM. Any betrayal of confidence is going to cost you and your business. Regular communications need to highlight awareness and participation in problem solving, workplace issues and project success .


### 6) Map Out the Future


Just like in a marriage, employees want to know where you're going. And again - what's in it for them. Have you got their back? Is what they're investing in your company going to be rewarded with better opportunities?


### 7) Embrace Challenge - and Reward Success


An engaged work force is one that's always ready for challenge. Make more decision making a regular part of the challenge and make sure that ideas and feedback are going both ways. Your engagement with your workers' ideas keeps the whole workplace focused, seriously on the established goals.  Rewards can be verbal, time off, flexibility, bus or commute incentives or even lunch, in or out of the workplace.


### 8) Focus on Acknowledging Strengths and Not Weaknesses


Lastly, you don't need to ignore worker's weaknesses. But by switching your focus to what they are doing right, you can shift the attention of the entire company or department to an area that supports the professional bond necessary to a long and fulfilling relationship.
