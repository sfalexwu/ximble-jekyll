Scheduling Employees across Multiple Time Zones is not only Necessary, it's Easy!





## Multiple Time Zone Employee Shift Scheduling: Technology Advances Make it Easier than Ever.


**Multiple time zone employee shift scheduling** wasn't always a necessity. A simple call center could get by with an old fashioned bulletin board. Even with multiple employee shifts, you post the shifts and hours and hope your people are good enough to show up.

Your business success always depended on personalities and on personally choosing the employees right for the heavy shifts. The others can pull up loose ends on the late or early morning shifts.

**But as years goes by, perhaps your company has seen the advantages to opening a second or even a third call center**. Maybe it's a bigger one, in a far off location, with different overhead costs and wildly different scheduling needs. Letting a local manager juggle those hours and those personalities was good for a while. Maybe it even worked well.

**The true necessity of multiple time zone employee shift scheduling** comes when you realize you've got to take back some of that control. Most organizations, no matter how big, don't maintain the same level of expertise at every center they're working from. This holds true in healthcare, in technology and just about every field that needs to be working in multiple time-zones. Especially if it's still managed from a central location.

******The advantages to centralization**, no matter in what industry, are still simply too big to ignore. That's true even when the advantages to having a local presence, local voices or a local call center are also too big to ignore. You simply don't need an expert in every time zone.

****In the continually expanding call center industry, to name just one example, NimbleSchedule is allowing call center managers to maintain a center full of top notch experts. In the expensive Silicon Valley, calls only come through once they've been routed through 2 much less expensive call centers in Philippines and Florida. All three call centers depend on coordinated multiple time zone employee shift scheduling. An expert from every discipline is on call, for every shift, no matter where they are located.

**The savings to the company have been significant**, especially in terms of keeping the more than 60 Silicon Valley experts happy in their jobs. Each of them enjoys a far greater degree of autonomy in selecting and volunteering for shifts, while turn-over has dropped significantly at all three call centers. Employees are also better informed about their schedules through their own smart phones and tablets about when they can take vacation or sick days, and the entire process is managed from the parent company headquarters in Chicago. Integrated easily with Google Calendar and Facebook, everyone in the company knows who is working when.

NimbleSchedule has worked with similar companies in communications, retail, food service and hospitality - all of them spread out over multiple time zones, but none of them spread thin.
