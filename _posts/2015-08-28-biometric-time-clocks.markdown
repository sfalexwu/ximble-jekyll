Following the demand on the market, we at NimbleSchedule developed an integration with a whole set of biometric devices, specifically fingerprint scanners, which help companies achieve better payroll accuracy and prevent “Buddy punching”.

With the whole list of [supported fingerprint scanners](http://support.nimbleschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/203755096-Fingerprint-scanners-for-time-attendance), our development and engineering teams made a bold step in helping companies put a stop to “buddy punching” and improve their payroll process without any possibility for a potential abuse as with some other, more traditional time clocking methods.

These fingerprint scanners are very easy to configure and use. Once you connect one to a computer, you can have your employees clock in / out with their fingerprint in no time. As fingerprint scanners are extremely efficient and accurate, you can minimize any delays during the clock in process for your early morning shifts, and have a whole group of your employees clocked in and ready for work in a matter of minutes.

Tracking time and attendance accurately and efficiently can mean the difference between running a successful business operation or failing to achieve your business goal. Stop losing money with “free-minded” employees and their “buddy punching” wizardry, and re-gain full control of your company’s future.

If you are interested in setting up this time&attendance; system for your business, please do not hesitate to [contact us](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/) at any point.

Stay Nimble!
