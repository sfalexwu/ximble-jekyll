If you are already a NimbleSchedule user, then perhaps you noticed another new page we added during our latest update. It’s simply called “Open Shifts”.  After hearing multiple similar requests from our clients, our developers and UI experts made an effort to build this easy to use, yet extremely useful feature.
 
Here’s a quick glance on the default view of our new “Open Shifts” page.

By default, all the data will collapse into location sub-divisions. As you can see on the screenshot above, there are two locations on this demo account: Los Angeles HQ with 43 open shifts and San Francisco with 31 open shift. From this quick overview, you can easily see the number of open shifts for each of your locations as well as some basic info about your locations. 

Through the filter on top of that page, you can slightly re-adjust the date range for your data and have a better overview of available open shifts. Initially, the filter will cover the following month starting from the current date. 

Once you click on the blue bar representing one of your locations, the whole table with the data should expand below. The data will be nicely formatted, looking pretty much the same like shown on the screenshot below:

The table should show the position name in the first column along with the number of shifts created for that specific time slot and that position. The next column will simply display the optional shift label, followed by the date and time of that open shift. On the far right you’ll be able to see the edit and delete icons allowing you to perform certain actions with those shifts.

Of course, as usual, managers will have access to their assigned locations only, as well as schedulers. Employees using our scheduling software will be restricted from viewing this page.

This simple to use overview should allow administrators and managers of companies with a lot of open shifts to easily monitor the availability of open shifts so that they can efficiently fill them in. Although this feature is a perfect fit for numerous medium and large companies using our system, smaller companies will also benefit from it especially if wanting to stay on top of this process.

Our team will continue to work on bringing new features and updates. As our aim is to make the scheduling process even easier and hassle-free, we plan on adding more functionalities that will make our scheduling software even more useful than it currently is.

Happy NimbleScheduling!
