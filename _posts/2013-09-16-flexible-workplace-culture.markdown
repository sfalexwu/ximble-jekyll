Are they working for you? _


## The Flexible Workplace Culture:




## What can you get out of it?


**Workplace Culture is an answer.**

It's a big one for retaining talent, improving engagement, morale and productivity.

And in spite of all of the strategies and schemes of HR departments, having the right culture in place beats them all. Any organization that's been around for a while, even three, four or five years, has a culture. And most of the organizations we speak with are considerably more mature.

Changing, altering or converting an established workplace culture might seem like a bigger task that you can handle.

But personality, tone, atmosphere and attitude are not strict laws that need to be respected. You can change them, but you've got to work at it.

You probably know already who to avoid - and what situations and places will cause problems if they're not avoid. More likely than not, everyone else in your workplace knows to avoid them too.

Those are just some of the negative aspects of an organic workplace culture and which usually stand out. If all of that negativity is the only thing defining your workplace culture, then you've got your work cut out for you.


## Flexibility to the Rescue


**Cultures are changed - sometimes slowly - sometimes quickly - through a series of actions, interactions and directives consistently applied.**

**You can do this.**

Very often, **NimbleSchedule** becomes a part of a company's work scheduling after a transfer of one management team to the next. Because we're flexible - all of the features of flexible scheduling can be slowly introduced for just the right teams, departments or individual players. Working towards flexibility (and transparency) and away from rigidity (and secrecy) are important, but of course you can do it at your own pace.

Workplace culture is already flexible. Yours may seem like it's not simply because no one is working at it.

Of course, we encourage companies that are in the process of changing, to let us ride along and make it easier.

The advantages to doing so - being flexible - rewarding key players with more flexibility - are so far flung and interesting and effective, that we can't help but get enthusiastic about them. That same enthusiasm seems to affect the people and cultures we're working with.

Developing strategies to work _with_ your culture is a lot easier when your culture is open, flexible and well understood. [We've written in the past about making sure everyone knows exactly what you're doing and why](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-retention-and-engagement-basics/). But that is really just the beginning.


## The Flexible Workplace Revolution


Every year, the number of American workers demanding more workplace flexibility increases. Every year it moves up the scales of the most important workplace benefits being offered. And surveys indicate that a lack of flexibility is one of the most frequently sited reasons for leaving or considering leaving your job.

As a talent management strategy, scheduling flexibility is among the most important of all workplace cultural factors. But there's that word again. **Culture.**

**Offering more flexibilityÂ  - in scheduling, in showing up, in deadlines and working hours - is a terrific introduction to a major change in the culture of your workplace.** American workers continually call for being treated like adults, for respect and for work-life balance. Acknowledging and encouraging those things as part of your new flexible workplace is what your culture can start to look like.

But like everything in a culture, you need to understand it from a bunch of different angles, make it work and make sure that the talent you're interested in keeping knows and understands it too. It's not high culture - it's workplace culture.

Younger employees are leading in demands for nontraditional work schedules. But that's not to say that older talent won't be immensely happy by their new cultural environment. You will be too. Get your hands dirty and your people will help out too.
