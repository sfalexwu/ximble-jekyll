There is a big difference in how small and large businesses handle various things - from the organizational structure to customer handling and the employees' working environment. What appears to be quite normal to large companies may sometimes look very strange to small businesses. In addition, different characters and career goals call for different selections. Therefore, this article will be focused on small business vs. large corporations and their advantages and disadvantages, in general.

Let's start with the working environment. Large corporations usually have more resources and money to invest into working conditions. However, as noticed in some recent studies, small business owners have started to invest much more money into making everyday working conditions way better than they used to be in order to keep their good workers in their companies. Consequently, this may lead to the fact that small companies start offering better working conditions than giant corporations. Yet, if building a business career is your goal, then those big players are an obvious choice for you even though getting a job in one of those large corporations may require some extra effort and multiple interviews and checks.

With a low number of employees, you might start feeling as a family member in a small company. While this may be a pleasant feeling for some people, it may become a nightmare if you don't get along with other team members and there is no other department or office to go. Obviously there are two sides of that medal. If you are an easy going person and you get along well with your co-workers, then working for a small firm will be a pleasure for you.

Getting some job done in a big corporation may involve a lot of bureaucracy and a whole process to get something verified or approved. The system is there because large corporations need to be careful about every move they make. As a result, this may often cause a headache, especially in situations when you need to get some procedure slightly adjusted. Are you a patient person?

Working in a small enterprise environment may require you to take on broader duties which are beyond your comfort zone. Unlike with those big corporations where you need to possess an expertise level in one or two specific areas, with small businesses that knowledge should sometimes be more extensive and may involve some learning process as well. On the other hand, you will have to get specialized in certain areas to work for those big players.

Although large corporations may offer career advancement opportunities, statistics say that small businesses offer better job security. As already mentioned, since employees start being treated like family members after a while, small business owners hesitate to fire them. The firing process becomes much more stressful for them because it is not easy to fire a family member, right? As an opposite side of the story, you might get fired in large corporations even if you performed well at your job. If the directive comes from the top that some employees have to be fired, your days in that company might become numbered. It appears easier to fire employees if you do not know them personally, as is often the case with big corporations.

As a conclusion, we can only tell you to pick carefully according to your skills and temper. Do not force yourself to be something you are not. Choose the best fit for your working environment and, hopefully, everyday duties at your work station will be a pleasant ride.
