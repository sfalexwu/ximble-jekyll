### NimbleSchedule adds SPRI Mobile Time Clocking to Help BusinessesÂ Spend More Time Watching The Bottom Line







<blockquote>**NimbleSchedule adds a new function to its time and attendance software that allows text and phone clock-in capabilities.**</blockquote>




Carlsbad, CA based NimbleSchedule announced the launch of SPRI (SMS and Phone Registry Integration) as an added feature to its online time and attendance software platform NimbleSchedule.com. 

The new function allows NimbleSchedule.com users to clock-in to their assigned work schedules from field locations via text, or calling in from their cell phone. SPRI is offered as a compliment to NimbleSchedule.com's online time clock utilities.





<blockquote>"Many of our customers have employees that spend the majority of their time at work sites away from their corporate office," said the company founder and CEO Peter Swaniker. With SPRI those employees can simply send a text message or call to clock-in for their shift."
</blockquote>




SPRI uses customer specific security protocols to verify that the employee is clocking-in from their phone or mobile device. Employees that use the system are automatically checked-in to NimbleSchedule.com's, cloud-based time and attendance software. The online time clock utility then matches the employee's information with their assigned work schedule. This gives employees the ability to easily stay connected, and managers the ability to monitor employee activity from any web-enabled device.





<blockquote>"With SPRI added to our increasing list of tools, like our Facebook integration and our proprietary shift management utility, we are developing NimbleSchedule to be the only choice for online time and attendance management," said Swaniker. SPRI can be added to any NimbleSchedule.com plan package and can be integrated quickly. Plan packages can be customized to match the complexity and budget needs nearly any size enterprise.
