**Top Ten Workforce Management Tools**

In today's work environment it is more important than ever to have multiple techniques when it comes to managing your workforce. The economy has created a more competitive environment when it comes to fighting for your market share. With this competition comes a need to proactively manage your workforce in a way which keeps them motivated and performing at a high level. There are many things to take into account with your associate base, and we will list the top ten workforce management tools here.

**1. Recruitment Strategy**

A solid recruitment strategy is key to any business. Without a recruitment strategy, many hiring managers will waste time and energy focusing on the wrong things and chasing down leads that are unqualified. It is imperative to determine the profile of the employee that your business is looking for, and then determine what avenues you can reach prospective employees for your business. A comprehensive, step-by-step strategy needs to be developed to attract the type of qualified candidates you are looking for. A budged amount for recruitment, where and how to look, who should do the recruiting along with recruiting success metrics are key features of a good strategy. Focused advertising, employee referral programs, and recruitment firms are all keys to a successful strategy development. In 2012, Southwest Airlines utilized its focused recruitment strategy to attract 50,000 applicants for 500 job openings. This allows them to hire the best of the best - so should you!

**2. Have Involved Ownership/Management In the Hiring Process**

As a manager or business owner you want to create a great company culture, a large piece of this is involvement from ownership and management right from the beginning. Research has shown one of the worst moves a business can make is having ownership or management disengage in the hiring process. This is such a critical piece of the business, as these are the people who will or will not drive your success. It is imperative to have ownership in a small business involved in the hiring decisions, and in a larger environment, it is important to have key leadership roles involved in hiring decisions, not just the hiring manager.

**3. Utilize Emotional Intelligence Testing**

It is important to assess both potential and current employees' levels of emotional intelligence. This can lead to better hiring decisions, as well as better growth opportunities for those in the company already. Research has shown that testing emotional intelligence is a greater predictor of job success or failure as it assesses the level of cognitive and social abilities. An emotional intelligence test can help formulate how well a candidate will fit into the organization, as well as how a current employee may fit into a new role.

**4. Remote Workplace**

Today, there is an increasing need for remote workers due to economic decisions as well as lifestyle decisions. With the technology available today, many businesses can handle a remote workplace a few days a week for their employees. This can help retain employees who have child care issues, and help drive down costs for commuting. Nearly 10% of today's workforce works remotely from home, and this will continue to grow.

**5. Create A Great Company Culture**

To get the most out of your employees, it is important to create a great company culture. This is one that celebrates success, and has transparent leadership. If employees can have fun at the workplace, and know exactly what their leadership is looking for, they will succeed. Research has shown that employees working for companies with an engaged culture are more productive on a daily basis and willing to take risks to benefit the company.

**6. Take Care of Your Top Talent**

Companies fail to take the best care of their top talent and instead often focus on the bottom 10% of their workforce. Instead of trying to fix the problematic employee, let them go. That time and energy should be expended with your top 10% of the workforce, encouraging them, spending time with them, and helping them grow. These are the people who will make your company great if you treat them well. Research has shown that top producers don't leave because they aren't paid well, but because their efforts often go unrewarded in other ways.

**7. Offer Unique Benefits**

To be able to recruit and hold the best employees, it is important to offer great workplace benefits. These need not just be health insurance, 401K, and vacation time. Some of the companies with the best retention are offering unique benefits. Timberland offers a $3,000 bonus for employees to buy a hybrid car. Eli Lilly allows one month paid leave before having a baby. Worthington Industries offers onsite haircuts to employees for $4.

**8. Offer Onsite Child Care**

With many families now having two working parents, childcare can be not only expensive, but a travel difficulty for working moms and dads. Companies now offer childcare onsite to help open up the labor force, and keep the business open for the hours they need their employees to be productive. Many companies can subsidize a portion of the childcare, making it more convenient and less expensive for their employees. In a recent survey it was found that SAS Institute, Aflac, Bright Horizons all offered the least expensive monthly options for childcare to their employees onsite.

**9. Employee Review Tools**

It is important that a company have a consistent method of evaluating employees on a regular basis. People want to know where they stand and how to improve to get to the next level. This conversation should happen more often than once a year. There are HRIS systems that can be adopted to make this seamless across the company. Benchmark Assisted Living has adopted this as a best practice and seen their employee retention increase 25% year over year for the past two years. They have also seen a 50% increase of promotion from within during that time period.

**10. Offer Performance Bonuses**

To best maximize production from your employees, offer performance bonuses based upon their individual performance as well as that of the entire office. Make these clear and known to everyone. Research shows that utilizing a performance bonus tied to the individual and the office goals is much more effective at motivating and retaining the workforce than utilizing a yearly bonus or a holiday bonus that all share an equal piece of.
