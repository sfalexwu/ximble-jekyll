The burnout syndrome appears to be getting more media attention these days as more and more people have started complaining about it. In the times of economic crisis or instability people tend to focus solely on their work and their professional careers at the same time neglecting their private lives. As a result, they start experiencing burnout syndrome symptoms.

The burnout can cause a lot of consequences in your personal life as well as in your job performance. The important thing is to know how to recognize some of the burnout syndrome symptoms and take appropriate measures before it’s too late.

Here is a list of the most common symptoms:

**• Reduced work performance
• Physical and emotional exhaustion
• Lack of motivation
• Reduced concentration or attention ability
• Insomnia and anxiety**

Although some of the symptoms are similar to depression, psychologists make a clear distinction between these two states. While depression permeates all areas of your life, burnout mostly affects your work and your job related duties.

The first step in the burnout syndrome treatment is to recognize its exact source. If the stress you are experiencing over an extensive period of time is coming from too many work related obligations, you should try talking with your manager or HR about it. There are many steps they can take, so an open and honest conversation might really help. If they do not show enough interest to help you cope with that issue, perhaps it is time to move on and start polishing your resume and look for another job.


On the other hand, if you notice there is room for improvements regarding the ways you handle work or certain tasks, then there are many things you could do to reduce the burnout syndrome.

• Try to dedicate some of your time to off-work activities, no matter if those include visiting sport events or just good old hanging out with friends for coffee or dinner. Reading a book or going for a walk might also be of help.

• Organize your work life in a more efficient way. Use the technology and available mobile gadgets to your benefits so that you could save your precious time Time Management Techniques.

• Get a good night's sleep. Try to organize your sleeping session and let them be no less than 6-7 hours each day. If needed, switch off your cell phone or any other electronic distractions. Remember that good sleep can improve your overall emotional condition apart from having your body physically recharged.

• Leave your work in the office. Learn how to dedicate more time to your family and friends. Stay off your phones during the dinner and while playing with your children. If you really must check your emails or voice mails, then try to schedule 30-45 minutes for that purpose somewhere after dinner time. If you have kids, then let that be a practice after setting your kids to sleep.

If none of these burnout syndrome treatment methods helps, or at least doesn’t help enough, then seeking some professional help might be the best idea. As mentioned earlier, if your current job is consuming too much of your life and you can’t seem to cope with it, then taking a short vacation to recharge your batteries or even looking for another job may be the only solution.
