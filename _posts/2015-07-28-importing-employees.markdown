If you have tried using some cloud-based systems to manage your workforce, then you are probably aware how time consuming and frustrating the task of entering your employees' info into that employee portal can be. Any system usually requires fulfillment of a series of steps until you get to the point where you can manually type in your employees' info and the whole process usually takes one employee at a time. God forbid if you discover that you made some mistakes and that you have to start all over, right?


<blockquote>**The whole idea behind our employee portal is not only to provide scheduling and time keeping options but also to make it easier for managers to do their job well whereas the main goal is to save both money and time. With that in mind, we perfected the importing process that allows you to import your employees' data via Excel or CSV file.**</blockquote>

No matter if you have all your employees' info in a single, or at least in a couple of files, this process will save you tremendous time. The only condition is that you have all your employees' details separated in columns in an excel file or by a comma in a CSV file. The only mandatory fields are the first and the last name. All other fields are optional so here are some additional ones that you can include:

**• Email
• Phone
• Employee ID
• Address Line 1
• Address Line 2
• City
• State
• Zip
• Country
• Position
• Department
• PayRate**

Even if you have some other data in your file, you don’t have delete them. While importing your file into our online employee software, you will have a chance to specify which columns to skip, if needed.

Once you insert your file into our cloud-based workforce scheduling software and map all the columns from your file to the right data type for our employee portal, it will take just a few seconds to import your whole list. No matter if you have 10, 110 or 1010, our system will flawlessly import your employee info so you can start using our powerful tool right away. It’s that easy!
