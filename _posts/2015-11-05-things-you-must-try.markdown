So you've decided to give NimbleSchedule a try. Whether you’re a trial or a paying customer, learning features, tips, and tricks will help you get the most out NimbleSchedule. That's why we’ve prepared a list of 6 cool features that will help you manage your workforce and expedite the process of employee scheduling. Let's dive in!



#### 1) Schedule templates

When scheduling your employees for a similar or exactly the same schedule from week to week or month to month, you can utilize many features that our system offers in order to speed up that process. One of those great features is the Template functionality which allows you to save a schedule for a week, month, or just a couple of days and re-apply that very template to any other date range. In cases when there’s a need to setup a rotating schedule, the template system is a real life saver since it allows you to apply multiple templates at the same time, and/or rotate them across various weeks. After you apply a template, your schedule will remain in the draft mode so you can always use the template as a starting point and then make certain adjustments before you publish the schedule and notify your staff members.



#### 2) Announcements and direct messages

With our announcement and direct/private messaging system, you can easily notify certain groups of employees separated in a couple of different ways. With direct messages you can send a message to all employees working in a certain position or a certain department in your company. On the other hand, with announcements you can post a message to all your employees working at a certain location. With both you can, of course, send a message to all your employees thus saving a lot of time when the time comes to communicate certain company-wide notifications or announcements.



#### 3) Job Codes


[![Job Codes](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-job-codes-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-job-codes.jpg)  
  
  

One of the optional things you can use with NimbleSchedule’s Time Clock is the Job Code functionality. Once you enable it in the settings section, you’ll be able to setup various job codes you need and have your employees clock out with a specific job code assigned. What that means is that you can easily monitor the time spent by your employees on certain job codes, being tasks, projects, clients, or any other relevant piece of info that you need to track. With a couple of different reports that allow you to filter out the data per job code basis, including the payroll report, you can easily stay on top of any kind of tasks or project costs.



#### 4) Text message notifications

With our online scheduler, you can customize what kind of notifications you wish your employees to receive from the system. In order to make sure that your employees are properly notified about any sort of last minute shift assignments or shift changes, then besides email notifications, you can also enable SMS notifications. With the power of text messaging, sometimes even combined with email notifications as well, you can rest assured that your employees will be properly notified and/or reminded about their shifts. No more excuses for missed shifts or late arrivals!



#### 5) Scheduling filters


[![Scheduling filters](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-scheduling-filters-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-scheduling-filters.jpg)  
  
  

With two types of filters showing up above the schedule, you can easily filter out just certain groups of employees for easier supervision. As an example, you can filter out just scheduled employees in the system, or just those who are not scheduled for a particular week or day. You can also filter out just employees available to work in a certain position or certain department. By using the power of these useful filters, you can easily stay on top of all your shift coverage needs and have the full control over who works when, and what kind of shifts and day periods perhaps need a slightly better coverage.



#### 6) Power Edit


[![Power Edit](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6-power-edit-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6-power-edit.jpg)  
  
  

In the Employees section above the list of your employees, you’ll notice you have access to certain tools that allow you to have basic and a bit advanced employee management. One of those options that takes things to a new level is certainly the Power Edit option. By using our Power Edit, you can simply mass change certain employee records for any number of your employees that you have previously selected. With this mass edit functionality, you can change certain data on your employee profiles in a matter of seconds.
