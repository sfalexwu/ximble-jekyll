When it comes to handling employee time tracking, NimbleSchedule's clients know they have many ways to choose from. Our time tracking software allows companies of different sizes to find the best method for their industry niche and specific needs. Apart from offering many different methods for employee time tracking, we also ensure the flexibility of the software itself, as it allows the use of multiple time tracking methods at once, depending on the need, event or employee skills.

One of the most popular methods of employee time tracking is using the QR Code and NimbleSchedule's Time Clock app for iPads and Android tablets. 



#### How does it work?



If you are a manager, all you need to do is print out QR Code cards for your employees and have a dedicated Android tablet or iPad positioned on a handy place in your company. Your employees, on the other hand, use their printed QR Code cards to clock in and/or out. The process is like this: an employee simply approaches the tablet or iPad and flashes their QR Code. The system automatically logs in the user and displays either the Clock IN or Clock OUT button in the middle of the screen. When an employee clocks in/out, the system handles that task and immediately shows the initial screen for the next employee to flash the QR Code card in order to clock in or out.



#### What's the good news?



The good news is that our QR Code Time Clock app is now completely **_free_**. Regardless of if you use an iPad or Android tablet, you can download our free Time Clock app onto your device and start using it right away. When it comes to the actual QR Codes, you can find your employees’ QR codes via Reports page. Once there, click on the Employees sub-section, and then simply select the QR Code report. The location of this report is highlighted on the screenshot below.

In case an employee forgets to bring their QR Card to work, there’s also an option to have your employee login in by using the username and password. Moreover, our standard smart phone app has an option to generate a QR Code on the fly for any of your employees.
