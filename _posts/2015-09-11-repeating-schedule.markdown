Business owners and managers of rapidly growing companies quite frequently feel they spend too much time on re-occurring administrative and employee scheduling tasks which takes them away from the actual focus of their companies.  That's why our engineers and developers brained up a whole set of features and tools that can help you automate that process. 



#### Repeating Employee Shift Patterns



While creating a shift for any of your employees, you can easily select one of many repeating patterns. When you select the preferred one and you publish or save your shift, that same shift will be repeated as many times as you want. This will save you from a lot of manual work needed for repeating the same process of shift creation over and over again.

If you were looking for an easy way to repeat a single shift for your employee on a daily, weekly or a more complex pattern, then this option is the best choice for you.



#### Copy To Next Week



Re-creating the whole schedule for your whole team of employees from week to week can cost you a lot of your precious time. There’s no need to waste it anymore on such tasks. With the “Copy To Next Week” tool, you can simply mirror the existing schedule from one week to the next one without any hassle.

By using this option, the system will clear the schedule from the destination week and copy it over with the set of shifts from the week before. Once the schedule is copied over, you’ll have a chance to tweak it and make it perfect before publishing  as the shifts will be copied over in the draft mode by default. When you are done with making your last minute changes, you can simply publish the schedule for the whole week.



#### The Advanced Schedule Template System



If none of the previous options isn't fit for your specific needs, this feature probably will. The complex schedule templating system was built to take care of 99% cases when you need a part of the schedule or the full schedule repeated across different weeks, not necessarily in a row.

If you need to build any kind of employee schedule rotation system, then our templating system is your best bet. You can build a whole set of templates, rotate them as needed and apply to any week. Moreover, you can even combine a couple of templates on the schedule for the same week, save custom date ranges or make changes directly on the template itself.
