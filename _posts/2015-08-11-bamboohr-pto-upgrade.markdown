Wanting to make life easier with hassle-free payroll, we included **the PTO feature** in the latest release of our software. For the time being, this feature is working as a natural extension of our system integration with BambooHR. The payroll report will no longer include just employees’ hours from the time clock but also their approved PTO hours, thus making processing payroll much easier and more accurate.

In case you use [BambooHR](http://www.bamboohr.com) for your company needs, then you are probably already aware that NimbleSchedule and BambooHR synchronize seamlessly and flawlessly. With such a powerful and reliable integration, you can cover almost the full scope of your company's needs regarding workforce management.

If you are already syncing approved time off requests from BambooHR to NimbleSchedule, there’s nothing you need to do in order to enable this new option.  If that's not the case, make sure you do that. As soon as you have both systems “talking”, your employees’ approved PTO hours will flow from BambooHR to NimbleSchedule and you will be able to view and review those hours on the payroll report page.

_**Note:**
The synchronization with BambooHR runs every 60 minutes, so once you make any change through [BambooHR](http://www.bamboohr.com), please give it up to 60 minutes for that data to appear in NimbleSchedule._

Stay Nimble!
