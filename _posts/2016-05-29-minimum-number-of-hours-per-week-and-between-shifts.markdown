When being of charge of creating a work schedule for larger groups of employees, it is very important to stay on top of all kinds of scheduling rules and limitations for different staff members. Some staff members cannot work more than a certain number of hours per week, while others should not work less than a certain number of hours per week. On top of that, there could be a lot more requirements that need to be taken into consideration when creating an employees’ work schedule.

With NimbleSchedule, you can easily set the following scheduling limits for each of your staff team members:

• The maximum number of hours per week
• The maximum number of hours per day
• The maximum number of work days per week
• The maximum number of shifts per day

As from the last update, we’ve added two new options that were frequently requested by our clients. Those new options are:

• The minimum number of hours per week
• The minimum number of hours between shifts

[![Work Schedule - Minimum Number of Hours](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Minimum-Number-of-Hours-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Minimum-Number-of-Hours.jpg title=)  
  
  


The new scheduling limitations allow you to specify certain minimums that need to be taken into consideration when creating a work schedule and easily spot any issues ahead of time, when it’s not too late to correct things.



#### Minimum number of hours per week



With this new setting, you can easily set the minimum number of work hours for each of your employees and have such staff members clearly highlighted on the schedule page for cases when they’re not assigned with specified number of work hours for the week.

Through the schedule page, you’ll easily see which employees were not assigned with their minimum number of hours for the week and easily adjust the schedule for them. As you can see on the screenshot below, those employees that do not have the minimum number of work hours for the week will have an orange exclamation mark right below their name with the number of hours also highlighted in orange.



#### Minimum number of hours between shifts



Through this new setting option you can specify the minimum hours between two shifts for your staff members. This is customizable for each employee, so you can easily tweak such a setting with different values for employees across different states or even different countries. Besides just specifying a specific number of hours between any two shifts, you can also tweak this setting to affect only shifts on consecutive days.

Although it appears as a minor tweak, this kind of setting can be very beneficial to companies of all sizes. For cases when you have employees working late evening shifts, you can now have the system show you a heads up pop-up window if someone tries to book that person for an early morning shift right after working a late night shift. Of course, there could be other scenarios as well where this kind of setting might be beneficial, especially with similar rules being implemented across different countries and states as a legal requirement across various industries.

Our engineering team continues to work on adding more features and options to the system in order to make your scheduling and staff management process easier. If you have any questions or comments about these new options that we’ve recently added to the system, please do not hesitate to contact us and let us know your opinion.

Stay Nimble!
