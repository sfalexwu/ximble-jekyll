There is always more than one way to create a schedule and organize your employee data in our scheduling app in order to streamline your rostering needs. Our engineering team keeps developing new functionalities which help companies and organizations segment their data thus ensuring smooth [staff management](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/) and scheduling processes. From now on, besides offering you a way to organize employee data across various locations, departments and positions, our employee scheduling app now offers you another layer that will help you out with the whole workforce management process. 



#### Introducing: Regions



If you want to edit your locations, an additional field labeled as “Region Name” will now appear in the Settings section. This textual field will allow you to assign a region name to your work [schedule maker](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/) environment and break down your data into more segments. Once you add your region names to all your locations, you’ll notice two new drop down menus in the system.

Once you add regions to your locations, a new drop down menu will appear above your location names in the settings area.

This new drop down will allow you to search through all your locations or to filter out locations in one region in case you select one and press the “Search” button. By doing so, our system will filter out all the locations assigned to the region you’ve selected.

From the moment you start assigning regions to your locations’ settings, you’ll notice a regions drop down menu on the scheduling page, next to your locations drop down. This new menu will make it much easier for you to look through your locations as they will be broken down into regions.

Having flexibility to add additional layers to the data organization structure and scheduling app process is particularly beneficial to companies having a lot of locations that are to be supervised. Nevertheless, if you do not need regions implemented, you can simply ignore that section since our engineering team organized this new feature as completely optional.
