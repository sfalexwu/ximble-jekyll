The challenge of managing employee payroll reports can sometimes be overwhelming no matter if you have one or thirty-one employee. After all, payroll management is an important aspect of any business. The good thing is that there are certain things you can do to make the whole process of payroll reporting much easier and less stressful. Here’s how NimbleSchedule can take care of your payroll management needs.

Once the shift is over and your employees have clocked out, it’s time for approval. You, as the manager can simply navigate to the Timesheets page and review your employees’ time punches. In order to approve them, you can use the “Approve All” button above the list, or approve one by one record by clicking on the gray checkmark next to each entry. When the check-mark turns into green, that means that such an entry has been approved, so you can move on. As soon as you have all your employees’ time clock records approved, you can run the payroll report based on that data.

In order to run the payroll report, you can just click on the “Payroll report” link in the Time Clock section, or navigate to the Reports tab and click on the “Payroll” link in the sub-menu there.

On the payroll report page, you’ll notice you have some options to select from. You can choose to cover just one out of your multiple locations or all locations at once. Moving to the right, you’ll have a chance to select all employees, or just some of them whom you want to include in the report. Next to that column, you’ll have an option to select some additional fields to include in the report, like the location name next to each entry, position names, pay rates for each entry, etc. These are just some additional fields, so you can skip them and the system will show the default pre-selected fields, so you do not have to worry about these. In the last column on the right, you can select overtime calculations, in case you need that, and whether or not you wish the system to exclude unpaid breaks from the totals on the payroll report.

Once you have all desired options selected, you can click on the “Generate” button in the top right corner and choose to see either a Detailed payroll report or a Summary. The names are pretty much self-explanatory but let us point out that with the Summary report, you’ll see one employee per row with the totals shown on the right. With the detailed payroll report, you’ll see an each time clock entry displayed in a separate line for each of your employees, with totals for each employee.
