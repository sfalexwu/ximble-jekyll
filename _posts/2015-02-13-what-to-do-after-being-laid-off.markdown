Whether there is an economic crisis or not, employees get laid off from their companies from time to time. Most people had such a situation at least once in their professional career. If that happened to you, do not despair and do not go into a panic mode. Here are some basic steps on what to do when laid off from work.

_Do not broadcast the message to everyone._
Although you may get an instinctive reaction to start broadcasting that message by complaining to your family and friends, that might not be the best idea. Some of your friends might have good work related contacts that could be helpful along the way in trying to find another job later on. Hence, do not broadcast the wrong message straight away.

_Do not panic._
Ok, so you have lost your job? Do not panic! Give yourself a moment to absorb everything that happened and take care of your emotions first. You do not want to start reading job ads immediately and applying to any job post that you notice. Take some time to think about your accomplishments in your work history and think well about your next moves. Statistics show that not that many employers find workers through job ads as you would expect. So organize yourself well, think about what you want to do, and make a plan for seeking a new job.

_Do not burn bridges behind you._
Try to leave the company gracefully, even though you might be tempted to give them a piece of your mind. Burning bridges behind you is never a good idea. Leave the room for some possible future cooperation and try to give a positive tone to everything, as much as possible, of course. Try to stay in best possible relations with your ex employer or manager as they might need you again at some point in the future. This does not mean you should sit and wait for them to call you after 7 days, but do not neglect that possibility at all.

_Optimize your spending right away._
If you had some vacation already planned and perhaps deposited some cash, see if you can cancel it and take the cash back. Pulling the money from your retirement fund is probably a bad idea, unless there are no alternatives. So think well about your financial situation and based on that determine some comfortable deadline for seeking a new job.

_Ask yourself if this is the right time for a career change._
If this is the second or third job you have lost lately, then take some time to evaluate if you are in the right business. Write down your biggest accomplishments and select carefully the things that make you feel good while doing them. This information might help you to properly set your career goals. In case your financial situation is solid, try some career coaching sessions as well.

_Start your job seeking campaign with a positive spirit._
If you already have a LinkedIn profile, then update your status accordingly letting your work contacts that you are in the market for a job. Even if you use other social media networks such as Twitter or Facebook, then update your work status and see if your friends or contacts have some ideas or recommendations. Employers love hiring new staff recommended by their trustful employees. With that being said, getting a recommendation from a business contact or a friend of a friend might be an excellent way to find a new job.

_Keep the positive spirit up._
While losing a job is indeed an unfortunate event and can cause a lot of stress, try to keep the positive spirit. If you don't take up some sport, then start doing some exercises or at least some running sessions with a friend or a family member. Keeping your body in a good physical shape will make your mind feel much better, which is just one of many efficient ways how to cope with being laid off.
