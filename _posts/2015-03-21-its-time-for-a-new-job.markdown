There are two types of people - the ones who are just never satisfied and happy with their current job thus changing their careers quite often and the other ones who simply fail to recognize clear signs that it’s time to change their job. The times when people would stay in one job until being retired are bygone. With the dawn of the technology era, business has changed as well as the ways businesses are handled. Consequently, job and career changes are more often than ever in the last decades despite the global economic crisis. 

If you are one of those people that have problems seeing the signs that it’s time to change the job, then one of our questions or suggestions may help you realize the situation.

[![How to Change Your Job](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/job-search-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/job-search.jpg)

_Are you experiencing any kind of verbal or sexual abuse at work?_

This is probably one of the most obvious reasons for changing jobs that simply screams that you need to seek alternatives. If you are being cautious and wish to explore alternatives first, then the best idea would be to sit down and have a talk with your [boss](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/signs-you-have-a-bad-boss/) and/or superiors. If that doesn’t help, then it’s definitely time for a new job.

_Is your boss or supervisor not taking you seriously anymore?_

If you have started getting less and less serious assignments, that could be a sign that you are no longer taken seriously by your managers. Whatever the reason may be - personal differences, a lack of faith in your skills and competencies, or any other trivia - there is very little comfort in knowing that. Looking for another job may be the only alternative.

_Is your working enthusiasm no longer on a high level?_

When starting a career and job in a new environment, people usually get all excited about new horizons and opportunities. Over time, that enthusiasm may slightly decline. Although feeling less [enthusiastic when going to work](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/be-happy-in-your-life-and-career/) after a couple of years of working for the same company may be normal, feeling completely noxious and anxious when going to work is a bad sign. You should try to re-evaluate the reasons for feeling that way. If the job simply no longer suits your ambitions or something else has changed, then you may want to consider looking for a new job or career.

_Do you feel swamped with your job duties and often find yourself working longer hours?_

Having a right [work-life balance](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/achieving-the-work-life-balance/) is an important aspect in our lives. While it may be feasible to sacrifice part of your free time to achieve better results or earn more money at work, in the long run, that’s not sustainable. Over time you’ll notice your results start declining progressively, even though it appears that you work more than ever. To make things even worse, if your job duties are just piling up while your pay rate remains the same, then you should probably re-consider your future with the current job.

_Is your career affecting your physical health?_

In case your job requires frequent overtime hours or travels which influence your physical health, then perhaps it’s time to re-evaluate your current job. Or, maybe you are just not a morning-type person and you can’t get up every day at 5AM. Whatever the reason may be, you should take those signs seriously.

_Are you stagnating and not learning anything new anymore?_

Remember the time when you started working at the current position and when you had so much to learn? If you found yourself in a situation where you feel you are no longer learning anything new, and you are just simply stagnating while doing the same routine work every day without any chance for a change, then that may be one of the reasons for changing jobs.

Apart from the scenarios mentioned above, there are certainly other signs more or less clear that may point your thoughts in the directions of seeking another job. In case that at least one of those questions we mentioned here made you really think about your current job, then perhaps you should start thinking about a new one even today. 

_“If you're trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I've had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.” – Michael Jordan_
