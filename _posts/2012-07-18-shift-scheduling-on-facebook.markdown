![Facebook Scheduling Integration](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/facebook-calendar.jpg)

**Some companies just ban Facebook in the office.**

The smarter ones adapt to it and get the most out of their employees and the benefits that a thoughtful social media presence can have for almost any company.

**NimbleSchedule has taken the whole thing a step further and now puts the most important part - for you anyway - right in the middle of the Facebook action.** Rather than banning Facebook to the old lunch room computer, face it, embrace it and use it to enhance the way your doing business and the way your company deals with employees.


**Employees are on Facebook now and they're using it during work hours, during off hours and pretty much around the clock.** They access it on mobile devices on and off the corporate network and some of your best and brightest are probably using it to do their jobs, to find sales leads or opportunities, to research and to learn and yes, just to socialize. Some of them may even be networking!




For some industries and careers, it may be the best way yet to get the schedule in front of employees' eyes. Imagine checking your next work shift like this...

Already fully integrated [with the more robust Google Calendar system](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/shift-scheduling-google-calendar/), NimbleSchedule's leap into the social sphere is another attempt to fully maximize [NimbleSchedule's already considerable employee retention capabilities](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-retention-and-flexible-scheduling/).

Employees can choose to view the schedule in either Google Calendar or Facebook along with a variety of other options.

Along with all of the automated notification settings that already make it the single best way to keep track of a wide and varied work force, we think it's also a terrific way to introduce your company's official Facebook and social media policy.

**If you're not going to ban it outright, why not make Facebook the frontline of your public outreach.** Along with a more satisfied, flexibly scheduled and content workforce, you also get the added benefit of having more of them talk more about your company - your products and your services - than ever before. Use NimbleSchedule to get your employee's increasingly complex schedules to them, and to signal the new social side to your company.

Experts recommend establishing a communications policy, being sure your entire team knows it and follows it, and then monitoring carefully.

We can guarantee that at least some of your team will love having their schedule embedded in and around their concerts and parties and professional events they're already using Facebook to learn about. The rest of them can get their schedule through the internet site, through their smart phones or tablets.


All of them will be happier with the increased communications, and the scheduling improvements that you're able to make. And we can almost guarantee that you'll be happier too!
