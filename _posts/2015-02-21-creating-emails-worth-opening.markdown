In case you decided to check the power of email marketing, then you probably already have a vision of the information you would like to serve to your subscribers. Creating the right type of emails to grab the interest of your audience and force them to interact and open your emails is a whole different story. With that being said, here are some tips that might help you get more out of your subscribersâ€™ base.

[![How To Write An Email](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/emails-worth-opening-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/emails-worth-opening.jpg)

_Content is king_. Think well about what kind of information you would like to relay through your email subscriber base. Is that content already available on your website? And if so, then why should the reader even open your emails? Try to use the email communication with your subscribers to notify them about some important stuff, or provide them with some neat tips and tricks about their interests. Do not just copy/paste the information from your website. That content can be seen whenever they want.

_Write appealing subject lines_. This tip might be one of the most important ones so make sure to learn how to write an email subject. Always have in mind that most of your subscribers might even delete your email without even taking a look at its content if there is no subject line.  As for the email subject length, it should be fairly short and relevant to the content. Moreover, it should intrigue your subscriber enough to click on and open it.

_Place relevant images in your email newsletter_. People process and remember images much better than a plain text. While you should be careful not to go overboard with too many images, and risk even your emails being labeled as junk or spam by some strict spam systems, well placed 2-3 images per email message should do the trick and make your emails look much more appealing to your readership.

_Make your emails worthwhile reading_. As mentioned before in one of our articles about [email marketing](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/email-marketing/), your email messages need to deliver some value to your subscribers on a regular basis. By getting your audience used to getting something out of your emails, a small discount coupon code, or an announcement of new products, your future email opening rate is guaranteed to rise. Consider it a small reward to the subscriber for reading your email message.

_Add user generated testimonials, if available_. If you have a [Facebook](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/) or Twitter page, or some other place on the web where users leave honest [reviews about your business](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business/) or products, then use some of those reviews and include them in your email messages occasionally. People genuinely like reading honest reviews made by other customers. Reading user generated testimonials is quite frequently one of the first steps that certain prospects do prior to engaging into business with start-up companies, like yours might be. So if you have such a content, make sure to include it from time to time in your newsletter.

_Ask your subscribers for feedback_. Generally, a lot of people like to state their opinion about various things. So why not occasionally allowing your subscribers to fill in a survey and get their opinion about your product or services, even about the content of your future email messages? While some people will not use the chance to provide their feedback, most of them will appreciate the opportunity to do so.
