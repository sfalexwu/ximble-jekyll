In order to manage your staff better and easier, you need the right set of tools and apps to organize your administrative duties, especially the repetitive ones. As usual, this is where NimbleSchedule comes into play and handles some of your work for you.

With our Time Tracking system, your employees can clock in and out for their work shifts by using many different methods:
• Clock in/out by using web panel/computer
• Clock in/out by using smart phone (Android or iPhone)
• Clock in/out by using Text messages
• Clock in/out by using phone call-in
• Clock in/out by using QR code scan app with iPad or Android tablet
• Clock in/out by using biometric/fingerprint devices

Of course, things do not have to be complicated. You can choose one or two methods and have your employees easily punch in for their shifts. On your end, things will be very simple and easy to monitor and supervise. Once your employees punch in and out for their shifts, those timesheet records will be available for your supervision and approval.

Through the _“Timesheets”_ page, you’ll be able to see those entries:

By using icons on the right, you can perform certain actions on such employees’ timesheet entries. The first icon you see there is used for approval. The grey check-mark icon means that the entry is not yet approved. As soon as you click on it, the color of that icon will turn into green and that will mean that your employee’s timesheet entry is now approved. Next to the approval icon you’ll also notice a pencil icon, through which you can edit each entry, and a trash icon which allows you to delete each entry.

Approving time clock entries one by one may sometimes be required if you wish to make sure that every employee clocked in for the right amount of hours. On the other hand, if you prefer to automatically approve everything without going through each entry separately, then you can use the _“Approve All”_ button above the list. This process will certainly save you a lot of time which you can put into much better use.
