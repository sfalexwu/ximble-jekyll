## Companies change. So does your workforce and your workforce requirements.


Businesses that used to rely on a staff of 30 or 40 full-time in-house employees today do better with remote and telecommuting staff. Often they grow to twice their former size, but the basic relationship with staff is vastly different.

Performance based and judged by every job well done, today's employees also depend on the freedom to come and go, to work at their own pace and to be judge solely by the work they can deliver.

**No matter how your business is modeled, your employees will thank you for allowing them greater freedom and flexibility.** Clocking in on the shop floor used to require a physical presence, but today, your employees, no matter if they're engineers or call-center representatives, can clock on and off based on the needs of the business, not the location of the clock.

Shift supervisors and managers are not chained to traditional clocking in and out, but, with NimbleSchedule, can enjoy a fully scalable system to grow with the company and employees on and off site. And you can schedule more, better workers for remote or distance locations, keep better track of their hours and retain full control over schedules, time-shifts and staffing allocations.

Sensitive information is kept secure on a central database and it’s accessible whenever and where ever you need it, and reporting is advanced, accurate and always in real time.
