The latest update release brought the separation of NimbleSchedule into two modules: Scheduling and Time Tracking. Another very attractive feature that came out with Version 6.22 is **the unlimited texting notifications add-on**.

With all enterprise accounts in our system, the “Communication via Text Message (SMS)” comes completely free. With this add-on activated, you and your employees can receive an unlimited number of text messages during the month without any additional cost being charged to your company.

Even the companies using our Standard plan, as they don't need all the features of the Enterprise plan, can activate this option as an add-on. If you are interested in activating this option, then please login to your account, click on the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the page and from there click on the “Feature Add-ons” link on the left hand side menu. Once there, among other add-on options, you’ll notice the “Communication via Text Message (SMS)” along with all the necessary info and pricing.

Our text message functionality covers more than 190 countries, so if your team is composed of employees spread around the globe, or your company simply has locations in different countries, then you do not need to worry about the coverage. Simply have your employees enable notifications they wish to receive via SMS and that’s it. No matter where they are in the world, they will be notified via SMS about any schedule changes, private messages or company announcements.
