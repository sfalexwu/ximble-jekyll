So you’ve started your own business and your company is doing really well? Good job! If you were lucky enough, the business you’ve developed probably revolves around some passion or hobby you always had, and now you're making money out of it. That’s the right way to go. However, after a while, when you put employees, clients, partners, taxes and billion other parameters in the mix, things do not always look so simple. Often times you burn the midnight oil, you're the last person to leave the office or you try to micro-manage everything  and everybody so that all the aspects could be perfect, and soon after, your days become pretty stressful. Here and there you cut some corners and skip a few hours of sleep, you skip a meal or two, and all of a sudden, your dream is falling apart because you feel stressed and burned out. Ouch!

**It doesn’t have to be that way!**

In order to continue helping your business grow, you have to think about your life, as well. In other words, your health, both mental and physical, and cutting down on stress are imperatives. How will you help your company if you can’t help yourself first?

In this article, we’ll mention some of the common things you can do in order to lead a stress-free life of a successful entrepreneur. 



#### Get a good night's sleep





_"Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the night.”
William Blake_



Sometimes you think that sleeping a few hours less than usual gives you more time to complete some important work. And true, you do this a few times, and it seems like your day lasted a bit longer, and, consequently, you had more time to complete your important tasks and duties. However, soon after, that rare occurrence turns into a habit, and all of a sudden, you find yourself sleeping only a couple of hours every night and feeling totally exhausted. 

Having a good night's sleeps is really important for both your physical and mental health. You have to feel well-rested in order to come up with new ideas and make good decisions when it comes to work, or any other aspect of your life for that matter. Keep in mind that when well-rested, you will have more energy, and you’ll probably conquer some important projects and tasks more easily. Try to force yourself to have regular 7-8 hour sleep nights, whenever possible.



#### Eat healthy food





_"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well"
Virginia Woolf_



Another aspect of life where it’s so easy to find an excuse and start cutting some corners is eating healthy food. If you run a successful,  growing company, then you probably don’t have enough time to cook or shop for fresh groceries every morning in order to eat healthy for the day. For most of the time, the easiest way is to just stop by at a fast food restaurant on your way to work and solve that problem. And sure, here and there that’s acceptable, but when that becomes a habit, then your health will definitely suffer. 

It is important to eat healthy in order to get all the important nutrients and vitamins. Therefore, make sure you always have some fruit on your table, which you can quickly grab and bite even when you’re rushing to work. Find some local stores selling fruit and healthy food, which are either close to your home or on a drive-by route to your office. In order to stay healthy, you have to eat healthy!



#### Deal with the clutter





_"When we clear the physical clutter from our lives, we literally make way for inspiration and 'good, orderly direction' to enter."
Julia Cameron_



A cluttered work space, or even living space, can sometimes make you feel overwhelmed. It is very easy to stop carrying about the mess on your desk when you have a lot of tasks and duties on your plate. However, having a very cluttered work or living space will make you spend more time trying to find things that you need.

Therefore, keep both your work and living space tidy and well organized. If you can find everything that you need in your office in the matter of seconds, you will save some precious time which you can use to deal with some on-going work issues and duties.



#### Don’t try to micro-manage everything





_"If you really want to grow as an entrepreneur, you’ve got to learn to delegate."
Richard Branson._



It is so easy to fall into the trap of trying to micro-manage everything with an excuse that you just want everything to be perfect. Soon after, the work days become hectic on your end and you find yourself running around trying to do everyone’s job. Stress becomes your daily companion quite easily.

In order to keep your mental sanity for the moments when you really need it to make some important business decisions, you have to get rid of the micro management. On the other hand, you’re allowed to be really picky when it comes to hiring your assistants or workforce. Namely, during the hiring process, take your time to find the perfect match for your company’s needs. Once you do, it’s time to delegate!

Assign specific duties and tasks to your team members and supervise the overall progress. You can’t do their job and you actually shouldn’t do that. You’re paying them to do the work, so let them do it. This approach will make your day much better!



#### Schedule everything!





_"Scheduling down time as part of your routine is hard but worth it, personally, even professionally."
Daniel Goleman_



Making all the previously mentioned things a habit is often times a challenge. What might tremendously help is formally scheduling your day for all those things in-between your work duties. Besides using your schedule for work commitments and duties, you should also start entering your personal things into the schedule. Save one of the time slots for a hobby, another one for some quality time with your family and friends, the third one for a nice walk or training in the gym, and so on. 

It is tempting to replace some of your personal things from the schedule with work stuff. That’s something you’ll just have to avoid doing unless completely necessary. Here and there some really important client or project may be big enough an excuse to break a rule or two, but do your best to avoid making that a recurring event.
