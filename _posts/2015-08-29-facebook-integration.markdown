While many companies are trying to prevent their employees from spending their work hours on social networks, others are seeking ways to put social media networks into use. Besides just pure marketing benefits one can gain from social media networks like Facebook, there are certainly other aspects where such accounts can be used for business purposes.

With the rapid growth of popularity of social media sites, the need emerged to somehow link pleasure and business and make a winning mix that would help companies and employees operate better at their work duties, or at least to handle certain tasks easier. Having such an idea in mind, our team developed a couple of spots in our employee scheduling system where you can put your Facebook account into good use for your work.



#### Using Your Facebook Account to Login to NimbleSchedule

As you perhaps already noticed on the login page, apart from logging in to the system with your NimbleSchedule custom selected username and password, you can also use some third party networks to login to your work schedule. One of them is Facebook. In order for you to use your Facebook login details to access your work schedule, all you need to do is to set your email address in NimbleSchedule to match with your email address on your Facebook account and you are good to go. Next time when you try to login, instead of having to remember another set of user login details for NimbleSchedule only, you can use your Facebook login info.



#### Connecting Your Work Schedule With Your Facebook Calendar

Besides monitoring your work schedule by logging in to NimbleSchedule, or enabling various email or [SMS notifications](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/unlimited-sms-messages-add-on/), you can also choose to connect your schedule with certain external calendars in case you use them on a daily basis. One of those external calendars you can put to work is Facebook calendar. 

By navigating to the “My Schedule” page in the “Schedules” section, you can click on the blue Facebook icon above your schedule and have all your shifts synced with your Facebook calendar. As soon as you connect that option, all your future shifts published by your manager will appear on your Facebook calendar. If you frequently use Facebook, this may be a great option for you to be notified about all your shift changes or new shift assignments.
