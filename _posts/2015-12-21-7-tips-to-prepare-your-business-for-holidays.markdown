#### Holiday discounts


Consider offering crazy sales discounts to your existing or new clients during holidays. Also, make sure to check what your competitors are doing in order to get some ideas. Once you have those magical numbers, start promoting your holiday offer. 

Put promotional materials around the store, send out an email newsletter, and use your social media channels to broadcast the offer. People are very sensitive when it comes to self-promoting emails or social media posts, so make sure your offer is so good that they can’t resist it!

You can also utilize passive advertising methods as well and put flyers and brochures around the store or replace your social media cover photos with the promotional images and wait for visitors and buyers to spot your great offer on their own.



#### Encourage the holiday spirit


Although your sales and customer support representatives should probably be smiling throughout the whole year, the holiday season is special. Encourage your employees to mention holidays when communicating with clients and share some of that holiday spirit with them. 

Use appropriate cheerful decorations around your store or on your website, which will place everyone into a good and special mood. Keep in mind that the holiday season may bring extra stress to some people due to their work obligations so make sure that the overall atmosphere in your store or on your website cheer them up.



#### Follow and join local community events


If you’re running a store and your local community plans on organizing some holiday events, make sure you’re a part of them. One of the best ways for your business to get some holiday promotion is to sponsor an event. 

Apart from contributing financially, you can encourage your employees to take part in holiday competitions and represent your company in the best possible way. Such activities may give your business some public exposure and get you more sales during the holiday season and beyond.



#### Get some extra hands on deck


Offering aggressive discounted prices during the holiday season can cause an increase in the number of people walking into your store. One of the last things you'd probably want is long lines with people getting frustrated for having to wait too long to close their sale. 

If you leave your customers and visitors waiting too long for customer service, or delivery of a product purchased on your website, rest assured that you WILL leave a bad taste about your overall service. 

Hence, make sure you have some extra help and some extra hands on deck during the holiday season. If you have enough employees to provide the extra coverage,you're good to go. If not, then make sure you hire some additional workforce for the holidays that will help your business run smoothly.



#### Boost your employees’ productivity


Use all available tools and methods to boost your employees’ productivity during the holidays. Actually, use them to boost your own productivity as well, which is even more important!

With so many apps and gadgets you could use on your smart phone or computer, there are no excuses to fail in this area. You can use various automated tools to post reminders to your employees or managers, display organizational plans to your team leads in a shareable environment or use employee management systems to organize your workforce schedule easily. 

There are certainly other creative ideas on how you could use technology to help you better organize for the holiday season. However, if you are one of those old schoolers who's not so fond of technology, a printed out holiday schedule, pinned on a visible board, may do the trick. Make it visually appealing so everyone gets reminded once in a while about the holiday game-plan.



#### Check your inventory


During those last minute preparations, make sure that you have enough product in stock to satisfy your anticipated demand. The same goes if you run an online store. Make sure you have enough of everything during the whole holiday season but especially during the holiday day itself. 

Nothing would be more disappointing to your customers than seeing half empty or completely empty shelves. So make sure you are well prepared and that your employees are fully aware that part of their duties is re-stocking the store shelves throughout the day. The best way to prepare your inventory is to plan in advance, but if you are one of those last minute folks, then make sure you’ve called all your suppliers to get enough of everything for the actual holiday.



#### Start the day a bit earlier than usual


When the holiday season comes, consider starting your day a bit earlier than usual. It would be great if you could get your employees to come to the store a bit earlier, but if they are not so fond of that idea, then your personal presence may suffice. Get there early, organize everyone, go one more time through your plans, and make sure you have everything ready to go. 

Let the holiday shopping begin!
