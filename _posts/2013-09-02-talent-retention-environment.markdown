## Talent Retention:




## Is your Workplace Environment Working for Your Business?


**Attracting and keeping the best players in the business is not in your bottom line interest.** Sure, it's far less costly to keep people working than to run through endless cycles of hiring and losing.

But the real money to be made will come in the form of** increased productivity and ongoing, excited, interested Employee Engagement!**

Even if you're burned out in the most lackluster call center - lost behind a shopping mall in the middle of nowhere - it does not matter. Increasing productivity and angagement is the only way to hold onto the employees that matter - and that could even ultimately save your business, should that be necessary.


### Creating, cultivating and maintaining a workplace environment that keeps your star performers engaged and productive is easier than you think.


Here's what you need to do.


### 1) Hire the Best


Well that probably sounds obvious enough.

Hire based on social skills, personalities and out-going behavior. **Hire weird people when you can. ** They're almost always the most valuable. Reward attitudes and ideas. Reward people who fight for what they believe in, even if they're cutting against the grain or their ideas can't be immediately implemented.

And really consider how their time is used or wasted by your scheduling requirements.
Use quality of the hire as your metric – not how fast or how cheap. Plan and execute a talent acquisition and retention strategy that hires the right person, not the available person. Dig for the right person, that person you can trust with your business. If it takes longer, it is worth it.


### 2) Values


**Now we're really harping!** ([not least because we've gone over this theme in the past.](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/))

Value your people, but most important, make sure that they know that they are valued because you're all together in a values-related enterprise. It's an exchange. If your people make your company more valuable then you - the company - have a responsibility to make the employees more valuable in turn.


### 3) Reach Out and Encourage Reaching Out


**Some of your employees are the best in their fields.** They are already engaged with industry organizations, associations and training courses. Make sure that they know that you're behind them and get behind them more. Learn from them, and encourage them to teach and share with others what they've learned.


### 4) Collaborate on Everything!


This can mean physical changes to office lay-out or it can mean schedule changes that encourage talking and group breaks and group lunches. The important thing is that your star performers are engaged with **- each other!**  And with the less than stellar performers. Challenging each other’s thinking, aesthetics, tastes, and ideas should be a top priority. And it shouldn't cost more than what you are spending now. In fact, you will find that it costs less.


### 5) Hire from Without!**
**


Based on the above, you should find that your star performers - your real talent - are playing up your environment. After all, it's their environment. and people naturally want to take pride in their livelihood, in the place where they are spending their time and resources.

That means, if you've got more talent singing the praises of your company, you should have a better referral and hiring system in place and working for you. Talk to and hire more of the people also engaged in your industry. They'll not only keep your talent in place, but **they'll be building value for you too!!**

**In the end, these people should want to make a difference.**

They should be actively inspiring trust and respect both inside and outside of the office, the shop floor, the workshop - or even that dingy call center. **Suddenly it's looking like a terrific place to work, isn't it?**
