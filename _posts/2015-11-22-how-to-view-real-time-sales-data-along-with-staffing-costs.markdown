In our previous articles we have covered many different ways which allow one to easily monitor staffing costs even during the scheduling process. What is even better, our staff scheduling software features reports that enable the comparison between the scheduled cost and the actual cost according to the time clock entries. This allows company admins to easily stay on track and monitor employee staffing costs throughout multiple reports and data sets.

In an attempt to provide an even better overview of the live company money expenses, our engineers designed a chart on our dashboard which allows an insight into scheduled costs across various locations. Initially, the missing link on that chart was the ability of displaying the sales information and providing company admins and managers with an easy to use comparison chart between the actual live sales data and staffing costs. With that idea in mind, and with the data served by our partners, widely known POS systems, our users can now easily stay on top of such information by integrating with some of them.

As you can see on the screenshot above, in cases when thereâ€™s an integration with one of our POS partners, the sales data feed will show up on the chart on the dashboard. The blue line represents your actual sales, while the red line represents your staffing costs. Aside from the weekly chart shown above, the system also featured the daily view, which will allow you an hourly gradation and comparison between your scheduled costs and actual sales data coming from your POS system of choice. Furthermore, to gain even a larger scale overview, our system features the monthly chart view which will show you the comparison of your live sale data vs scheduled costs for the last 30 days.

<blockquote>With such information at fingertips, company schedulers and managers can now make their schedule decisions easily and re-arrange schedules according to the actual live income data. This allows much easier company management with significant gains in effectiveness and costs control.  Companies do not have to waste their money on scheduling extra employees for days, or hours during certain days that do not bring enough income which would justify such expenses.</blockquote>



By all means, there is nothing revolutionary about this small adjustment to the system that was made by our engineers and developers. However, a bundle of such small tricks and tools along the way is what makes our online staff scheduling system stand out from our competitors and allows easier and better employee schedule management. Our team continues to deliver new tools and gadgets that will ensure even better management of staffing needs, while helping you save some extra money. Stay tuned for more Nimble updates!
