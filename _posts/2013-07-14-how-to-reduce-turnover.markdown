## ![How to Refuce Turnover](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/staff-recognition.jpg)How to Reduce Turnover and Still Keep Your Business Growing


**Learning how to reduce turnover is one of those great un-sung learning processes that just not enough people ever begin.**

The simple fact is, reducing staff turnover doesn't just happen when you raise wages or hand out gifts and compliments. It just couldn't be that simple so don't even dream about it.

No matter what industry you're in, you're probably not looking at the real problem. It just doesn't come down to not enough money or not enough perks.

**Employees quit because the person supervising them is not well trained to keep them there. **

If that sounds like an over-simplification, keep reading. We think we'll convince you.

But while most firms will meet and talk about how to solve the employee turnover problem, very few of them will directly confront the issue of training supervisors to properly keep them there.


## "How to Reduce Turnover" in Five Easy Steps...





### 1) Have a Meeting.




Alright, you've heard that one before. But get your entire staff in on the problem, and you've already gotten them in on the solution. Asking them for help is a way of making this a two way street. And their help contributing a little more helps make your staff into a company. They get the idea.





### 2) Keep It Together, Yourself!




Nothing will un-inspire stressed and possibly over-worked employees like a boss who is losing it. Take time not just to thank employees but get to know more of them and inspire them. And you do need to look and act the part the entire time.





### 3) Compliment Specific Tasks, Not "the Job"




Staff members do need hear they're doing a good job.  But not in the abstract. You're not addressing the entire job, and thus letting the staff member know that they're doing great can result in them feeling they can relax and take it easy. Motivating employees means pointing out exactly what was done correctly, point by point, and perhaps even approaching them with a list that can be shared with others. Staff members need to know precisely which behaviors will be rewarded and they need to be able to repeat them. It's not really about good feelings, so much as about encouraging the right behaviors.








### 4)  Look After the UnderPerformers




Everybody loves a star. Except of course for those who aren't shining quite so bright. While it makes sense to reward those who are truly out performing everyone else, you want to pay attention to the most discouraged and who are possibly already facing bigger challenges. If you can reward them for even minor improvements in performance the impact can be much greater than for those who've come to expect regular rewards.





### 5) Be There When It Matters




A formal job review is frankly too late. Catching your stars, or your less-than-stars, in the act of doing something good, or correct or right or beneficial is what matters. It matter to other member of a team, and it matters to each individual employee, too. Don't leave it to chance that you're going to remember.


That brings us back to what we were saying above. Are you the right person for this list? Are you sure your line supervisors are reading the same things that you are? If you're not getting them onto the same page that your on, then your chances for success are seriously reduced. **Share this article with all of them, and let us know how it goes.**
