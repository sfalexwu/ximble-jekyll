In the world where technology blurred the line between work and personal time, it is hard to separate those two important aspects of one’s life. When should work stop? _How can I achieve a healthy balance between my job and my personal life?_ These are just some of the questions that bother many people who are aware of the importance of work life balance. Here are some of the things you could do to achieve this supreme goal.

[![Managing Work Life Balance](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/work-life-balance-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/work-life-balance.jpg)

• **Assess the priorities in your life.** If needed, make a formal list which will help you to easier understand and see your priorities. Ask yourself what would be the most important things that you would like to achieve or maintain in your life and make a list of 5-10 things. Once that you have that list in place, it should be much easier for you to focus on those priorities.

• **[Manage your work time](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/) better.** Try to determine the tasks that take you too much time on a daily or weekly basis. If available, you can use some tools for time tracking in order to have a clear vision of your work day and of the pain points that simply waste too much of your precious time. 

• **Do not multitask and focus on one thing at a time.** It is proven that multitasking will not get you more things done than focusing on one thing at a time. What’s even worse is that multitasking can make you feel overwhelmed and probably frustrated at some point. This all could lead to degradation of your productivity and having to spend more of your free time on job related stuff.

• **Turn off your cell phone while [spending time with your kids](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/parenting-and-business/) or spouse.** In order to have some quality time with your friends, spouse or kids you must stop worrying about work all the time or checking your email 10 times in an hour. If you really must, limit yourself to one-two email checks before you go to bed or after dinner. At other times, try to keep your cell phone turned off or simply leave it at home if you are going out with your friends (this does not apply if you are expecting some really important call, though).

• **Schedule your private time.** If you are so passionate about your work that it is hard for you to resist doing some of your work duties, no matter how minor they may seem, even when you are not in the office, try to schedule yourself for certain events which might help you focus better on your private life. That can be either watching a football game with your friends, going out to the theater,  or simply reading a book. Any kind of an activity that makes you relax deserves a recurring spot in your schedule.

• **Work on some healthy habits.** Do you have enough sleep? Do you eat and drink healthily? Do you exercise at least once in a while? All these questions are here to help you determine whether or not you are good at managing work life balance. Try to work on these things and you will be amazed how a slightly better lunch menu and a little bit of exercising can make you feel better.

• **When was the last time you went on vacation and for how long?** Try to book at least a 10-15 days’ vacation every year. If you prefer winter over summer, you can plan on visiting some nice ski resort and spend your vacation time with your dearest ones surrounded by idyllic nature . This will re-charge your batteries for sure. 

• **Learn [how to delegate better](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/).** If you are a manager and you feel exhausted after fulfilling your daily tasks, re-think the process of delegating. Do you have the right set of people working for you? Do you trust them enough to delegate some tasks to them? How about some really important assignments?

• **Keep re-evaluating all these things on a recurring basis.** If you are constantly finding yourself struggling to find a right balance, then make a task of re-evaluating your work – life balance a repeating one. Every once in a while sit down and take some time to go through these steps over again. Are you getting some good results or is there some additional tweaking to be made?
