Flexible scheduling has really come of age with internet based scheduling and open shift software. Here's how a more flexible schedule can benefit your employees and your business.


# **Employee Retention and Flexible Scheduling**


**Flexible Scheduling Software Has Revolutionized the Company –Employee Relationship**

Accommodating the needs of mobile, highly specialized and high quality workers is more difficult than ever. Employee turnover is expensive, inefficient and, for some companies, totally out of hand. Unhappy employees cost almost any company far more than owners or stockholders would prefer. Yet flexible scheduling, which has proven one of the single most effective employee retention policies has only caught on in limited sectors of the over-all economy. Namely in technically advanced industries that have traditionally relied on more mobile and remote workers.

Still, one of the reasons companies have stuck with the old-school, hard scheduling is simply because it was easier. Week after week of 20 or 40 hours for everyone, and time off and vacations only when applied for a week in advance is just how it was done on paper. And that's how it stayed.

Allowing employees and local managers greater control over the work place used to require dozens of phone calls and hundreds of hours per year just in scheduling and shift-planning.

But as more and more employees find better opportunities to meet their own needs and still earn a living, the onus is on more employers to hold on to the employees they've got by offering more forgiving schedules, and more opportunities to do the work that needs to be done, irrespective of when, if not always of where.

The advantages to flexibly scheduling employees and allowing employees more control over their schedules and over the time they spend on the job can be dramatic.



	
  * **Far better balance between work and family issues**

	
  * **More options, about when to work, what hours and what schedule**

	
  * **Increased loyalty, commitment and productivity**

	
  * **Longer term commitments and lower turn-over**

	
  * **Higher morale**

	
  * **More and better home-based or otherwise remote employees**

	
  * **Reduced overall labor costs**


The fact is, with more and better managed seasonal and part time employees, many businesses are even able to significantly reduce salary and wage costs while still maintaining high quality, satisfied and enthusiastic employees.


## ** The Real Revolution in Flexible Employee Scheduling**


Flexible scheduling depends simply on up-to-date internet based calendar and messaging systems that put every employee on the same calendar page.

Such a system allows for on-the-fly schedule changes, replacements and updates as easily as changing a calendar program. Automated messaging, consent and confirmation systems mean that every shift can be covered and very few excuses for being un-informed remain.

For example, an open scheduled retail shop might rely on more part time store workers picking up 4 hour shifts convenient to their own schedules. The total number they can schedule is limited by a master schedule, controlled by the manager, but every shift is voluntary and over staffing becomes virtually impossible. The manager simply limits the number of shifts that each employee can volunteer for. When ever the schedule is changed or altered, every employee gets an email or text notification and the entire staff is happier, having selected, swapped and traded shifts until the schedule is finalized or until each shift begins.

All of that just depends on the manager's preference and the needs of the company. It's really that easy and we've seen expensive staff turn-over nearly eliminated from some companies.  We'll be writing more detailed case studies in the future of companies using [NimbleSchedule](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/features/), but if you'd like to add your own story, simply leave a comment in the section below.
