_Employee Scheduling Software is working harder than ever, but it's only to be as effective as what you put into it. Here are ten things you should get out of it._


## 10 things your Employee Scheduling Software should be doing to make your life easier and your business happier!


[![Employee Scheduling Software](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Employee-Scheduling-Software-.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Employee-Scheduling-Software-.jpg)Lots of workplace improvements make lots of tough-to-keep promises. Your employee scheduling software probably offered ease of use, happier employees and lots more easier flextime scheduling, too. Hopefully, you've seen all that happen. But lot of managers don't study automated email management tips the way that people in marketing and communications do. [That may be changing](http://thecynicalgirl.com/the-automation-of-human-resources-is-near/), but probably not soon enough.

The point to building and maintaining an automated email system is a lot more than just getting more information in front of your employees. When done properly, you're working on building a culture of today and one that gets out exactly what it puts into your team or teams. That means, you're not just sending notes that say "Work today at 4:30" and "Bill called in sick. Who wants another shift?"

Your employee scheduling software also lets you send out messages anytime you want, exactly like the email system you may already be using to target different teams and to make the entire operation more efficient.

In addition to those normal notices, these are ten of the things that should be sent out to make your message clearer, your culture more success-oriented and your productivity skyrocket!


### 1) Every day is a chance to commit to your brand


Every day that you're reminding people to show up,  you should also be reminding them why they're on the team. Not hollow appeals to values that upper management betrays, but real reminders of how the [corporate organization adheres to the values](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201002/what-do-corporate-values-really-mean) that all of you believe in.


### 2) Continuous Improvement Reminders


Again, you don't need to be critical. Every work shift should be a chance to - ready - [INVITE CRITICISM!](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/continuous-improvement/) That means, every time your new schedule goes out you can remind people that it's up to them to make things better. The challenge for management to is listen, respond and reward those with the most innovative ideas.


### 3) Establish, Refine and Clarify Goals


That doesn't have to mean sales or productivity goals, though those might work as well. But sub-goals and step to step encouragement and acknowledgement are the way to go in your regular and automated emails.


### 4) Recognize and Acknowledge!


You don't have to say "You're doing a great job." Some acknowledgement and appreciation  means a lot and gives you better results too.


### 5) Organize


One of the crazy things we learn in automating systems is that lots of businesses are disorganized in all kinds of crazy ways. Sending out regular weekly or bi-weekly emails is a great way to always start planning - and **lots of firms find that their schedule mailings work better than the company newsletter.**


### 6) Send productivity notes with your regular mailings


It's not just "work harder" either. Your teams want to know where the numbers are, what their successes have been, and where they stack up next to everyone else. You can customize notes so that everyone gets all or part of the latest news.


### 7) Pick Your Culture Up Off the Floor


Seriously. You know that if 1,000 people read this article only ten of them will have the courage to make culture into an issue today in their workplaces. Those are the ten that will succeed too. Most companies run crappy cultures because they are afraid to do something cultural. **Slip something important, personal and true into your mailing. **


### 8) Change the Policies that Do Not Work


Announce them here. Make it matter and tell people why and exactly how the policy was changed.


### 9) Use Your Regular Mailings to Build Transparency


Numbers, Numbers, Numbers. Employees will take the bad news with the good and if it makes sense to them, then they can give you better numbers. It doesn't hurt to tell people what numbers, and what they mean or might mean, but the more transparent you can be, the better numbers you'll see.


### 10) Engage!


**You too! Bored, listless, scheduling and HR manager: Get engaged!**

Any automated email is only ever as good as the person setting it up. So don't send out the same boring list of days and shifts and hours. Make it good. Make it count and what you get back will count for you too. We can hear your eyes rolling, but the problem is, so can the people reading your emails. Remember that.
