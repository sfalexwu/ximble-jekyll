Managing a team in a single office or in the same town is a fairly easy and simple process. All you need to worry about is your employees being notified about their schedule on time and having them actually show up for work. On the other hand, when your business starts growing and spreading to other locations across the country or even around the globe, then things can get more complicated. Having to manage employees across different timezones could represent a major issue and may cause some headaches to team managers or schedulers.

While evaluating different needs for various business, our engineers at NimbleSchedule decided to address the need of managing teams across multiple timezones and make this process much easier and intuitive for team managers in such situations. With our shift planning system, you can easily have each of your team members set a completely different timezone through his/her profile.

[![Shift Planning With Different Timezone Coverage](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Work-Schedule-Employee-Profile-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Work-Schedule-Employee-Profile.jpg)By adding such a functionality, our engineers and developers easily solved the problem of employee scheduling and their time off managing. You can now have each of your team members view the schedule according to her or his own local timezone configuration without worrying about a possible confusion. Our shift planning system will simply convert the time for each user in the system according to the profile timezone set without any need for a manual adjustment.

In case your employee needs to request a time-off, he can do that without having to worry about time differences. In other words, your employees can simply input a request according to their local time and you as the manager or supervisor will see those entries in the schedule according to your own timezone set.

The same goes both for the scheduling process and for all notifications. Each shift notification, either by email or sms, will simply reflect the time of a timezone selected by an employee.

Furthermore, if your employee decides to use the smart phone app, his shift times will be simply adjusted to his phone time. If you, or your employees frequently travel across different timezones, then you certainly do not need to worry about the time difference while either looking at your personal schedule or managing your employeesâ€™ schedule. NimbleSchedule does all the heavy lifting for you.
