NimbleSchedule offers Android and iPhone apps to its respected subscribers without any restrictions or additional costs. By using our smart phone apps, employers can easily monitor their employees’ time and attendance in cases where they do not necessarily come to a single clock location post.

**An Intuitive App Interface For Great Experience**

Our team of UI experts carefully designed the app's interface thus ensuring outstanding user experience. An easy navigation through intuitive menu options and simple use of all available functionalities are just some of the values of our app system. Once employees download and install our apps from Google Play Market or iTunes App Market, they can login to the system using their login credentials and start monitoring their schedule, submit requests and clock in and out on the go.

**One Touch Clocking In and Out**

When remote time clocking is necessary, employers can easily enable mobile clocking in for their employees. As soon as that option has been enabled, employees can start clocking in and out by using their Android and iPhone. By simply clicking the “Clock-In” button in the middle of the screen through the Time Clock section, an employee can clock in and signalize to our system that his work time has started. Once that has been done, all managers and supervisors will be able to see which employee is currently clocked in, from where and for how long.

**GPS Time Tracking is Automatically Enabled**

To make things even better, our system features GPS time clock stamping of each employee’s clocking entry. This means that employers do not need to make any settings or perform any actions. Our smart phone apps will simply generate GPS coordinates for each employee’s time clock entries, empowering the company administrators and supervisors to easily monitor and track locations used by employees to clock in to the system.

**One Click to View the Map With GPS Coordinates**

As soon as any of employees clock in to the system, supervisors get access to their GPS location by simply clicking on the GPS icon next to each timesheet entry. A popup window will show with a map and the exact location pinpointed on the map from where an employee clocked in for his work time. This piece of information provides a better insight and control over time tracking and boosts overall supervising.

**Why Should Your Company Use This Method?**

In order for your employees to perform better, they need to be provided with tools they are comfortable to work with, the ones that are simple and easy enough to use. What better method could be utilized than using their own personal smart phones for such actions. They already know the system they use and they feel extremely comfortable with such a solution. This is why this method has been one of the most popular features our system has to offer.
