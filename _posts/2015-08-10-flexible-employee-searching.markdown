Our mission is to make employee scheduling as easy and efficient as possible. With that in mind, Version 6.22 of NimbleSchedule included several key enhancements aimed at saving you time on recurring tasks.




<blockquote>One of these enhancements is **a more flexible and easier-to-use search option through the scheduling interface**.
</blockquote>

When searching for employees, you can now type just part of a name, or simply the first letter, and the system will return all matching records. 





<blockquote>This enhancement allows for faster overall scheduling by locating employees in a flash. We hope you enjoy this new functionality.

Stay Nimble!
