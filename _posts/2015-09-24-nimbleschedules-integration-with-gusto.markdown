With the rise of popularity of cloud systems, it has become extremely important that you make all your necessary and favorite cloud tools talk to each other in order to make your work day easier. Among all those different systems - HR, Payroll, Time Tracking or Employee Scheduling - there has to be a certain point where all of them can sync and work together. NimbleSchedule is that glue that keeps everything together!

Our integration with Gusto, cloud-based [payroll software](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/gusto-payroll-software-integration-adjustment-payroll-service-done-easily/), will save you time, money and nerves when the payroll time comes. Namely, Gusto, formerly known as Zenpayroll, provides a simple and easy to use payroll system that allows companies to handle their employee payroll process in no time. Hence, our integration with Gusto is one of the key elements to synchronize your employees’ time clock entries in just a couple of steps and execute the payroll process with no hassle whatsoever.

Once you navigate to our Application Integrations page through the “My Account” section, connect your NimbleSchedule account with your Gusto account. Then, link your employee profiles on both ends and sync your payroll data in a matter of seconds.

As soon as you have all your employees linked to their respective Gusto profiles, navigate to the Payroll report page in the Reports section and select your preferred options for the Export. You can choose between multiple locations, employees and you can select different overtime calculations. Once you are ready, click on the “Generate” option and select the “Export to Zenpayroll” option. Your data will be synced over to Gusto and you are almost done. After you re-check the data through Gusto and confirm that everything looks good, you can complete your payroll process.

A tedious process of entering all the data manually across various systems is part of the history. Synchronization between NimbleSchedule and Gusto saves time and money for your company or organization. There is no need to waste your precious time on such administrative tasks anymore.

Stay Nimble!
