While creating NimbleSchedule, our engineering team implemented multiple ways to handle specific tasks related to work schedule management. Namely, different companies have different [staff management](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/) requirements. This is why it was very important for our team to ensure flexibility when it comes to our online schedule maker in order to allow different business niches to use our system with ease. With that said, here are a couple possible methods for you to roster your employees through our online shift planning software.



#### The Simplest Approach for Shift Planning –  the Shift Creation Popup

The easiest way to quickly schedule any of your employees for a given day and given time is to simply navigate to that specific day through our shift planner and click on the right day for the right employee. Once you do that, a popup window will show, like the one shown on the screenshot above, allowing you to set various parameters. The mandatory fields are:

• Position – Allows you to select one of the available positions for which your employee is allowed to work
• Department (in case your company uses this feature) – Allows you to select the department for your new shift
• Start time and End time – This is where you set the time slot of your employee’s shift



<blockquote>Aside from these mandatory fields, you’ll also have a chance to enter a shift label and shift tasks/notes, as well as to choose a repeating pattern, in case you wish to repeat that specific shift for a couple of days or weeks.</blockquote>



Furthermore, through this popup window you can also edit the shift data. Once you click on an already created shift, you’ll be prompted to edit the details. Besides just editing the information, you can also choose to delete the shift you’re editing or to send it to Open Shifts.



#### The Advanced Work Schedule Maker Option – The “Create Shifts” Menu

For a bit more advanced approach to the multiple shifts creation, you can use the “Create Shifts” menu above the schedule. First, select the position needed. Once you do that, the system will show you a list of employees eligible to work in that position. From the list of available staff members, you can select more than one person that needs to be rostered for the shift during a specific week. When you’ve selected employees needed to be scheduled, you can complete some basics on the left, like the shift start time, end time and optional notes. You can also choose to repeat such block of shifts for a couple of weeks as well.

Aside from selecting these shift basics, you can also choose the days of the week for this new shift. This approach allows you to bulk create a set of shifts for multiple days in a week, and possibly multiple employees as well, through a single process menu. This method allows you to spend  less time on your staff schedule management and focus more on important aspects of your business.



#### The “Import” Feature For Power Users

Apart from already mentioned features, our system allows clients to import their schedule by using the Excel or CSV file format. In case you already have your staff schedule pre-created or exported from another system, you can easily import it into NimbleSchedule and save yourself from hours of manual work you would usually spend to create a new roster.

Instead of repeating all the steps needed to complete the schedule import process, I’ll rather direct you to our amazing support article covering this topic with exact instructions on how to [Import Schedule](http://support.nimbleschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/202707603-Schedule-Import).
