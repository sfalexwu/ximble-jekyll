The financial industry is a major employer in all developed economies today. Being multifaceted, it offers a wide range of jobs from traditional professions, like accountancy, banking and insurance, to entry level finance jobs in the financial sectors of companies or the public sector. After obtaining a degree, the business graduate can choose to specialize in areas like risk management, financial controlling, or treasury, or in more glamorous professions such as equity and bond trading on stock markets.

The employment quest should start by analyzing career options, selecting the industry sectors that are in need for new professionals and focusing on the entry level finance jobs that align with one's long-term interests and competencies. As there are countless finance degree careers, it may take years for one to find the best fit, but eventually this time-consuming search will pay off. Being a highly skilled industry with many opportunities for gaining professional qualifications, finding the most suitable niche in the finance industry is worth all the efforts.

Most employers are now looking for the skills that are much wider than traditional ideas of numeracy. They include:

- good relationship skills 
- leadership skills
- numeracy, accuracy and excellent computer skills
- commitment and motivation, as top jobs require long hours
- team playing, as lot of work is nowadays done in project teams so the ability to work in teams is of crucial importance
- networking which can be essential in jobs like accountancy or investment banking 

When applying for entry level finance jobs, applicants should send their resumes together with their cover letters, summarizing their main qualifications, achievements, and skills. The cover letter needs to be adapted to the demand of each particular job advertisement as it is intended to show the employer how the applicant fulfills the requirements of the company's recruitment profile. Note that some employers may want to select only the applicants that already have relevant work experience so gaining some experience even by working for free during internship will be beneficial - that will at least ensure that one receives a letter of recommendation for the work done from the supervisor.

Once hired, some workers might be expected to complete certain periods of training. In other words, they may need to gain qualifications through evening classes or day-release programs, which will demand their full commitment and motivation. 

To succeed in the finance industry and beat out the competition, one must have desire, intelligence and discipline. It may not be so difficult to break into this industry yet it will be tough to build a reputation of a serious and successful player. If one is highly motivated, soon he will see himself moving up the corporate ladder and enjoying the fruits of his labor.
