Usually when people move to a new city or a different part of a city, they consult with their new neighbors or friends about the best school, dentist, babysitter or anything else they might need. If you were that person at any time in your life or you were the other side advising a friend or a neighbor about a specific product or service, then you are already aware of the power of the word of mouth marketing strategy.

Although it is vital to maintain a good image and reputation among your customers, this image can rarely be anything else but truth. So the most important part is to have a good product or an excellent service. If your company provides them, then you have a good starting point.

OK, you have a good product or you offer an amazing service, now what? Leaving everything to chance is a bit naïve tactic. While indeed it is not you but others who need to spread a good word about your company, there are numerous ways of encouraging them to indirectly help you while carrying out your word of mouth marketing strategy.

With the advancement of the Internet and Social Networks in particular, this process became a lot easier. All you need to do is leave such a good impression on your clients that they will become interested in following your company via Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. As soon as they start following your company or writing any comments, all their friends will see those comments coming from the source they personally know and trust. As you can see, the power of word of mouth on the web is extremely powerful.

Keeping some kind of connection, at least through social networks, can be of great benefit for your business. However, you need to put some effort in that process. It is not enough just to create a page on some social network and that’s it. Occasionally you have to interact with your past clients, create interesting and engaging posts related to your business or product, etc.

Sometimes you need to discover people who have a strong influence in their companies or communities. This may require some extra work or time because it is not easy to wow influential people, yet, it may be worth the effort.  Therefore, do some research to find those ideal people that have a major influence over your targeted demographics. Once you do find out such info, you can make an additional effort to leave a good impression on such people.

Remember that the success of this tactics depends on whether or not people trust your brand. So you really need to make your company stand out in some way. This can be done only if you have an exceptional product or a service coming at a reasonable pricing. Although there are companies that base their word of mouth marketing strategy on offering cheap yet poor quality products, it is always advised to provide good and quality products at reasonable prices.

If possible, try to conduct a poll with some of your clients, or at least friends or employees about your product or brand. Promise them anonymity and then go through those honest opinions. This process can help you improve your weak points and strike back with a better product or service.
