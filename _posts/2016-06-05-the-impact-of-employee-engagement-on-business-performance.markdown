One of the crucial components of success when running a business is having highly engaged employees. Naturally, that’s not the only important thing in the business equation, but it certainly is [a distinguishing factor](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/163130/employee-engagement-drives-growth.aspx) among competing businesses with similar products and strategies. Furthermore, high employee engagement is not only good for an organization itself but also for employees as they can significantly benefit from it by achieving higher income and getting promotions ahead of others. In this article, we'll cover six obvious benefits any business has from highly engaged workforce.

**Increased productivity**
It is a fact that the employees who are more enthusiastic about their job and who care about the company’s interests are more productive. Consequently, employees with [higher productivity](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-increase-productivity/) complete their duties sooner than the others, at the same time achieving better results. Often times they are motivated to go the extra mile to get the job done the right way.

**Reduced absenteeism and late arrivals**
Employees who are highly motivated and engaged with their job are eager to come at work because they feel good in the work environment. This significantly decreases the number of late arrivals and such staff members are less absent from work than some of their disengaged colleagues.

**Increased satisfaction**
Highly engaged employees are more satisfied with their jobs, and as such, they may positively influence the whole working environment. Moreover, a positive attitude towards work and a willingness to go the extra mile to do the job the right way can have a positive impact on customer satisfaction as well. This is especially true when considering staff members working in direct relation with clients, such as customer support representatives, but the story doesn’t end there and often times extends to pretty much any role in the company.

**Improved retention**
Finding the right employee for the job can be quite a challenging task. But when you do find one, your job is not done. Keeping your superstar employees in your company is as important as finding them in the first place. That's why it's important to know how to motivate employees. Working with staff members on their motivation and trying to boost their engagement can significantly influence the employee retention rate as well. Highly engaged employees are satisfied with their jobs; they have more opportunities to climb the career ladder and chances for leaving the company are much lower. 

**Boosted profitability**
As a result of increased productivity, higher working morale and better work results, the profitability of the company can be significantly increased as well. By boosting your employee engagement, you can influence the profitability of your business and set your company on the path of success. Highly motivated and engaged employees reduce the operating costs, not only in the area of late arrivals and absenteeism, as mentioned before, but also in terms of an ethical approach when dealing with the company’s funds and expenses.

**Improved communication**
Anyone who's worked in a team knows how important it is to maintain a high level of morale and healthy communication in the work environment. Highly engaged employees, with their higher commitment and morale, significantly improve internal [team communication](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/easy-and-effective-communication-tools/), which results in better overall team results and a more positive work environment.
