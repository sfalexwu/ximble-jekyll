## Don't Let Your Employee Schedule Creator Make a Mess of Your Staffing




### Seven Tips For Keeping Things Moving


First and foremost, working with the right employee schedule creator should not mean turning your crew into a bunch of robotic zombies. The point is to keep the scheduling managers from going crazy - and to get better results from the people doing the work.

Scheduling employees is not just writing down names into a complicated calendar.

Scheduling manager without a scheduling platform are taking somewhere between one and eight hours every week to schedule employees - in Excel or on paper or anywhere else they can find. We have seen some pretty creative techniques. The problem remains that, when a manager is doing it, it's just not going to be done to the employee's liking. It's not just a matter of preferences either. It's also a matter of vacation days, legitimate time off and regulations regarding overtime.

So it doesn't really even make sense to have managers doing your scheduling.

On the other hand, letting your employees do it themselves takes some getting used to. These are the seven most important tips we came up with for letting your employees better schedule themselves, and without sending them to the cleaners. Check here if you have [legal or regulatory concerns.](http://www.laborandemploymentlawcounsel.com/2013/12/to-flex-or-not-to-flex-top-issues-related-to-flexible-workplace-arrangements-and-their-legal-compliance-solutions/)

** 1) Structure Your Flex Time**
Not every employee needs 40 hours of flex time. Most of them will like it, but doesn't mean they won't do just as well with a day or two. You'll seem some of them taking advantage of the new hours, but many of them will wait too. Make sure you set restrictions on overtime, if overtime is available and, of course, be sure your scheduler is accurately recording hours on the job.

**2) Make Everything Public**
This should go without saying, but you may need to spend some time preparing and distributing and even explaining your new procedures, policies and reasoning. Employees get it. Make sure you do your homework and spell out everything clearly. And get employees to acknowledged by everyone.

**3) Save Time and Then What**
Time saving software is like that. You end up spending so much time learning to use it, that, the net gain isn't realized till many months later. Still - while we can promise that NimbleSchedule is simpler to use than anything else on the market, managers will now also spend time on the points mentioned above, and on better engaging in their jobs, instead of just on scheduling.

**4) Forget about Adjustments**
Minor changes, sick days, kids' school or doctor appointments; all of these things add up to an incredible cost in terms of lost time, and especially for the scheduling manager. So here's your net gain in hours and cost savings. Forget about them. Once the policies are in place and the software is launched your managers can better manage the job at hand and not have to worry about who's coming in and when. They can always check on their cell phone or on the Internet like everyone else in your shop - even when half your staff is calling off.

**5) Autonomize**
Self Scheduling gives employees a tremendous amount of autonomy. If you're interested in keeping them, you just did the right thing. The ability to better determine when and where they'll be "there" - or anywhere - is a huge boost to your ability to keep and grow the relationships that your organization wants to keep.

**6) Consider the implications of 24 hour scheduling**
Some few new users of NimbleSchedule will consider seriously upping their service hours. [Even fewer will go to full blown 24 hour operations](http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/mar/28/24-hours-business-challenges). But changes to schedules need to be handled, and most of them will be, quickly. Scheduling managers, perhaps obviously, will not only need to adjust to reviewing schedule changes, and the technical aspects of doing so. Very often that means limiting such reviews to once or twice per day, perhaps in the morning and once in the afternoon.

**7) Work on Optimizing Your Message**
Calendar software is already "automated email software" so [don't leave your message up to a machine](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/calendar-software/). On the contrary, seize the opportunity to make every message count and count for good.

Going forward on a better employee schedule creator is a big step - [though our team is always ready to work with you](http://support.nimbleschedule.com/categories/20025943-Community-Discussion-Join-the-Conversation) so that the transition and roll out are ultimately simple and smooth. Is there a tip you wished you'd hear before you rolled out your new scheduling software? Please let us know in the comments below.
