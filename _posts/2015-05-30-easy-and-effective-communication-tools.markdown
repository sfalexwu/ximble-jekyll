Having an easy to use and effective communication tools to broadcast your messages to your employees or get important info from your workforce or managers is an important piece of puzzle when running a successful business. Aside from the announcements functionality, NimbleSchedule also offers a direct messaging tool that allows you to send a private message to just one employee or to group of employees thus increasing overall employee engagement.

One of the easiest ways would be to click on the “Send message” link in the bottom right corner of any page in NimbleSchedule's panel. Apart from that option, you can also click on the “Inbox” link in the top right corner of the page and then simply click on the “New Message” button. By clicking on any of these 2 options, you will be prompted to a new popup.

Once you get to this popup dialog, you’ll have an option to select whether you wish to send your message to a specific group of users in the system or to select a specific person. 

The group option allows you to select a specific department or a position as the recipient. This means that all employees with the selected position or department on their profile would receive such a message. 

Through such a functionality department managers or administrators can easily communicate with just certain employees working in a selected department or a position. 

If needed, you can also select the “Specific people” option instead of the “Groups” and simply select one or more employees that you wish to receive your message.

The rest of this process is very straightforward. Besides the subject of the message, you can just fill in the message body, and simply click “Send”. Once you have dispatched this message, your employees get notified instantly. Of course, depending on their notification preferences, your employees may or may not be notified about this direct message via email or SMS as well. In case some of your employees have chosen not to be notified via email or SMS, then a new private message will be clearly visible as soon as they login to the system.

Besides reading your message, your employees can respond to it, either via email directly or by logging in to NimbleSchedule and responding through our easy to use interface.
