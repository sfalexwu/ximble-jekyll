Managing employee work schedules or time clock entries with NimbleSchedule is extremely simple and easy. You schedule your employees, they clock in and out, and you approve their timesheet records. **But how about using our schedule maker system for a bit more advanced workforce solutions? **

One of the optional features in NimbleSchedule is the **Job Code functionality**. By activating the “Enable job codes” option in the Time Clocking section of the Settings you will enable the Job Code functionality for your account.

Once you do that, you will notice another option appearing in the Time Clock section of our system labeled as “Job Codes”. That new option will allow you to add new job codes to the system as well as to add an optional description tag for each entry. Later on, all your employees will have a chance to select a proper job code while clocking out, either while using the web panel or their smart phone.

The use of the “Job Code” field will allow you to track certain projects or tasks and determine the exact number of hours your employees spent for such work.

Besides tracking the task or project information, you could find a different use for the Job Code field as well. For example, in case your employees are serving a list of your clients during their shifts, then you could optionally use the Job Code field to track the exact number of hours and costs attached to each of your clients. These are just some of the ways you could use the job code functionality but, of course, you could find your best fit.

Apart from tracking the job code data on your employee timesheeets, there are some reports in NimbleSchedule that allow you to have an overview of the job code usage.


<blockquote>**One of those reports, and probably the most important one in our schedule maker system, is the Payroll Report. If needed, you could include the job code field in your payroll report as well, by selecting it in the section for additional columns to include into your company’s payroll report.**

Furthermore, you could even group your payroll report per job code, which will enable monitoring of the relevant information grouped for your specific job codes. This kind of feature will allow you to easily track staffing costs and the number of hours spent on performing such tasks and assignments.</blockquote>
