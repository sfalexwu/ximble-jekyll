In today's modern and global economy, companies play an important role in addressing various social and environmental issues. By being socially responsible, companies are becoming a driving force for resolving or helping out numerous social issues, either locally or, quite frequently, globally. By not doing so, companies even risk losing their reputation.

However, what does it mean to be socially responsible? Is it enough to donate annually $100 to one of those organizations raising money for different causes and that's it,  you have done your part?

In an inspiring talk at a TED conference, Fred Swaniker (a Ghanaian-born serial entrepreneur and a brother of NimbleSchedule's founder - Peter Swaniker) highlighted a personal example of raising global social awareness. Although Mr Swaniker expressed his concerns about political dictatorship regimes in certain African countries, he also presented his revolutionary ideas about helping young people and students across Africa in their attempts to become new leaders that will change their countries and, eventually, the whole continent.

In his passionate talk about his beloved Africa, Mr Swaniker presented some of the problems in which many recognized other regions around the globe as well. Building societies with strong civilian control and reputable institutions is a task that may last for decades or sometimes even centuries, but it seems that for some countries or regions in the world this is the one step forward – two steps back story.

Getting more people to believe in right goals is the mission that lies before all of us. Overwhelmed with daily work tasks, do we have enough time to think about the social issues affecting our local communities, not to mention certain nasty situations that are happening in countries that may be far away from our every day talks?

By playing an active role on both the political and social scene, companies and their leaders and employees have an impact on the world we live in. Even though people tend to consider large corporations as being greedy and not thinking enough about social and environmental issues, it appears that there are more and more corporations and individuals speaking for the right cause. Whether we are talking about gathering food or clothes for the homeless, or encouraging democracy in the third world countries, the progress is more than visible. What is especially encouraging is the fact that young people have become more involved in this process.



#### How can your company help spread awareness?



Generally speaking, there are many ways in which companies and their employees can accelerate the whole process and develop better social awareness in communities and/or societies.

By motivating employees to do their best while performing their work tasks and exploiting their expertise and competence, companies may achieve much better results in their effort to be socially responsible either on a local or global level. For example, by using 50 IT experts to collect garbage for 8 hours in a park, you can achieve wonderful results, but could we use 400 IT specialist hours for achieving even better result through various online activities?

Offering concrete help through the use of your company’s product or service is yet another great way to help organizations or individuals fighting for the right cause. One of those examples is NimbleSchedule’s discount offered to all non-profit organizations based on any payment term. This is a practice which is not limited just to us as a lot of other socially responsible companies are helping in similar ways with their products or services.

Of course, donating cash to certain organizations or organizing fundraising events is the right step to do as well. Although volunteering hours or resources is extremely useful, for some causes a financial donation is the best way to help.

We strongly believe that all these different organizations and activities are getting us closer towards the goal of having healthier and socially responsible communities around the world. Are you ready to contribute to this cause?
