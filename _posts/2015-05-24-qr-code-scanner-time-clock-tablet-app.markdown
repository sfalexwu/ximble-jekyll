Frequently business owners reach out to us seeking alternatives to regular clocking in methods due to their company's diverse requirements. Most of our competitors cover just the basics, but when it comes to flexibility regarding time clock methods, then that’s where our time clock software is unbeatable. Aside from the regular clock in methods (via computer or smart phone), we also allow business owners to activate additional options like time clock via SMS, phone call, QR code scanner and biometric devices. In this article, we’ll cover the QR Code Scan – Time Clock Tablet App.

Namely, our engineers designed a very easy to use and simple Time Clock app for tablets, both Android and iPad. More specifically, you can use your web-enabled portable device and mount it somewhere on the wall or on a desk in your company and make it a clock post for your employees.

Using a time clock tablet for this purpose is pretty simple as long as you have everything connected. You just install and run our Time Clock app from either the Google Play market or the iTunes store and you are ready to go.

Once you run the Time Clock app on your Android tablet or iPad, you can simply have your employee approach the device, flash his QR Code in front of the camera and our time clock software will automatically log him in. Next, the only thing an employee needs to do is to click the big button in the middle of the screen with the label “Clock-in” and that’s it. The process is automatically completed and logged out, so the next employee is ready to flash his QR Code.

Depending on your preferences, you can either have those QR codes printed out for your employees on check-in code cards, or simply have them use their smart phone and flash the screen from our regular NimbleSchedule app with a QR Code generated. If you’d prefer to print those codes out, then you can login to your NimbleSchedule account and navigate to the Reports section. Once there, click on the “Employees” option in the sub-menu and then choose the “QR Codes” option in the drop down, and click the “Filter” button.

Our engineers continue to work on designing new options and methods that will ensure even greater flexibility frequently needed due to various types of businesses using our time clock software.

In the meantime, stay tuned and stay Nimble!
