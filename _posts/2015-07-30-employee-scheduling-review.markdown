![8-1-2015 2-50-55 PM](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/8-1-2015-2-50-55-PM.png)It is clear that a clean design is important to the creators of **NimbleSchedule**, an online employee scheduling application that offers one of the most user-friendly interfaces in the industry. Additionally, the Software as a Service (SaaS) model gives businesses – big and small – scheduling software that fits everyone who needs to use it. The tools are easy to use, with attention given to the details of scheduling tasks and automation to help you get work done and move on to more important matters.




**1.** You can make the employee scheduling software work for you in a variety of ways, from the daily, weekly and monthly scheduling options to the time-off and shift-trade requests section to the basic reports that are available to managers. **NimbleSchedule** also offers helpful additional features, including a mobile application for you and your employees, so no one has to wonder who works when. 


  

  





**2. ****NimbleSchedule’s** dashboard includes several at-a-glance pieces of information, including an hourly layout of the current day’s schedules and links to helpful articles available on the company’s blog. The scheduling software proves to be one of the best on the market with its numerous tools and time-saving features, which is why it receives our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award.




### Scheduling Capabilities 9.5/10 


NimbleSchedule really shines compared with other ranked software in our lineup when you consider the dashboard. The design of the application makes it very easy to go from being a scheduling application amateur to being reasonably adept in a matter of minutes. Tabs at the top of the scheduler make it clear where you are within the program, and it’s easy to switch between schedules, requests and reports. The dashboard gives you an at-a-glance look at the daily, weekly and monthly schedule.

You can easily map out hours for all of your employees at all of your locations and then synchronize with other calendars, such as those in Google and Outlook. NimbleSchedule includes a drag-and-drop feature on its calendar; you can simply click, drag and drop one person’s shift to another day. The auto-scheduler further simplifies the process and frees up even more time with a dialog in which you can enter the number of employees needed for a shift and have the application assign workers.

As user-friendly as the NimbleSchedule interface is, it wasn’t without faults. You can include wages when you’re adding a new employee, but once you hit save, if you haven’t entered wages, the option disappears. You then have to enter wage information through the Positions section. This adds a couple of extra steps, which reduces efficiency.



### Report Information 9.8/10 


Beyond scheduling, you need an online scheduling application that organizes data for you to aid you in improving your business in several areas. You can run reports on employees, schedules and payroll. There are several reports you can run through NimbleSchedule, and there are parts you can customize, but not nearly as many as some others in our top 10.



### Help & Support 10/10 


f you run into an issue that you can’t solve by yourself, you may need to seek NimbleSchedule’s help, which comes in several forms. The website has many resources for you to find the answers to your questions or solutions to your problems, including a user forum, a FAQs section and a knowledge-base. In case you need more help than you can find on the website, NimbleSchedule offers a live chat option and customer service representatives you can correspond with by email or phone.



### NimbleSchedule Summary: 9.8/10 


**You would be hard-pressed to find a more user-friendly interface and powerful scheduling application than NimbleSchedule’s. The company excels at giving its customers the best tools and the best dashboard on the market. Although it doesn’t offer as many reports or as much customization as other services, NimbleSchedule still pulls way ahead of most of the employee scheduling software pack.**
