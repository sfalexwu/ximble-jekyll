In order to make our interface as easy and intuitive for use as possible, we are constantly making some UI improvements. This includes our latest update release that came along with a couple of tweaks that should make your employee scheduling process much faster and easier. 

**Time Clock on the Dashboard page**

One of the most obvious changes we made to the user interface is the time clock option which we added to the dashboard section. This covers all user roles in the system, so no matter if you are an employee or the manager, you’ll be able to clock in or out for your shift directly from the dashboard.

**Short shift blocks handling throughout different pages**

For better handling of short shift blocks, especially those that last for less than 60 minutes, we made a lot of improvements throughout different pages of the system. This includes weekly and daily views for employees on their “My Schedule” page. Additionally, some tweaks also covered the Daily view of the “Everyone’s schedule” page for administrators and managers. For really short shifts you’ll now notice that the system will display a tooltip with the full shift info while hiding the text from the interface.

**Timesheet filtering within a certain time span**

Besides filtering timesheets within a certain date range, or just from a specific location, the filter in the system now also allows you to select a specific time range along with the date. By using this functionality, you can easily filter out just your AM or PM shifts, or any other time frame from the selected period.
