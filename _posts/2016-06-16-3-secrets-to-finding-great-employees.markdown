Your employees are (or should be) your most valued asset. They are your brand’s face to your customers and they can make you or break you. But how do you find super star employees? Here are my 3 secrets: 

**Ask Current Employees**

It’s said that we tend to “keep like company” so one of the best ways to find great employees is to talk to your [current great employees](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/ideal-employees-among-us/). Let them know that you’re looking for a new hire. Ask them if they have friends that would make great employees. Honest hard-working people tend to have friends with similar traits so your current employees can be a great source for prospective employees. You can even incentivize your employees to help you find good people. Offer them a cash reward for every new hire that stays. It doesn’t have to be extravagant, even something simple like a gas card shows your employees that you value their help in finding the right people. 

**Ask Around**

Ask your friends and family if they know anyone that would be a good fit. Presumably, they’ll want to help and will help you find good people. Never assume that your friends know that you need people just because you have a job posting on LinkedIn or a 'Now Hiring' sign in your window. Go out of your way to ask them. Let them know exactly who you’re looking for. If they don’t know of someone, they can always keep their eyes open for you.

**Keep Your Eyes Peeled**

You never know where you’re going to find your next super star. It may be in the most unlikely of places, so keep your eyes open as you go through your day. If you receive exceptional service at one of the places you frequent, take note of that and ask the person if they are interested in applying for a position. You may even want to hire your Uber driver (I found a great intern that way)! Using websites like LinkedIn and asking connections for referrals is a great way to find a great employee. 

**Build vs. Buy**

Hiring employees is expensive. There is a cost for recruiting. Time and expense of training. So, whenever possible, leverage your investment. One of your best, potential places for finding your next great employees is by growing and grooming one of your current “good” employees. If someone shows good initiative, cares and works hard, do what you can to cultivate them as an employee. Train them. Teach them. Groom them.  Show them that you value them. Reward them when they do well. And that doesn’t necessarily mean money. You can give them special scheduling accommodation, or give them a holiday or birthday off. The more an employee feels valued, the more likely they are to strive to do more. 
Your employees are your life blood. It’s hard to find truly great workers, and in order to do so, you may have to think outside the box a bit. Once you find them, do everything you can to [keep them](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/5-secrets-to-keep-your-best-employees/).  Whether you find them, grow them, or take them from your competitors, you need to invest in them and challenge them.
