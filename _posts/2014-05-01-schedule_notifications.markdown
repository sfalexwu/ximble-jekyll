We recently added the option to set your own display name for email notifications. For example instead of the standard display name of "Schedule Support", you can now configure your account so that emails display under "My Company Schedule". To update this, click on "My Account" at the top of the main page and select "Company Information". From here, you can then enter your own email display name.
