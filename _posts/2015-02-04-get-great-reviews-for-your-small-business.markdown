Having a great product or an excellent service is not a guarantee that your business will survive in today's economy. Many companies now invest a lot of money in branding and advertising, yet, as we explained in one of our past articles, [the word of mouth](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/the-word-of-mouth/) is one of the best and most efficient ways to put out the word about your business. An excellent mix of all those methods are actually reviews which you can obtain from your existing or past clients.

While many companies invest in their social media or other advertising campaigns, not all of them have a way for their customers to leave a public review about their business. When it comes to online business, it is not a rare occasion that prospects will first use a search engine to find honest and independent small business reviews about some website or service on the third party network prior to engaging with that business. This is especially the case when it comes to small companies and relatively new online firms. With that being said, it appears extremely important to have a set of loyal customers that will write an honest review about your business on the third party websites and networks, allowing potential prospects to read the comments about your company. Yet, how the question is how to get business reviews?

First off, you must get your product or service in the best possible order. If that includes your extended work hours to supervise your employees and their communication with prospects and clients, then so be it. Each step in the process should be properly taken and every feedback from a client or prospect should be addressed in an appropriate manner. Once you ensure that that your product or service is at a satisfying level, then you can start thinking about ways to utilize positive feedback you got from your clients.

If your support team assists your existing clients and  provides answers to your prospects via any online method, then you should be able to provide a link for them to write a review about your service. For example, you can ask your clients to provide honest feedback about your service via your internal system, or by using some third party review app or network.

Expecting that your happy customers will seek review websites where they could say a couple of nice words about your business is unrealistic. Yet, if you provide them with an easy way to do that, for instance by posting an embedded link in the email footer which would lead them to a form where they could leave their positive feedback, a lot of your clients might do it. That way, not only will you get real  customer testimonials for other online visitors to see but also valuable feedback about the ways you handle your business so you can act on every reasonable criticism.

By ensuring that your product or service is highly competitive with other offers out there, and by providing the best possible customer support (via phone, chat, ticket, email or any other means of communication), you are on the right path to get business reviews worth showing off. In addition, by providing links either on your website or in your emails to leading to your social media channels or third party review websites, you will help your customers focus their reviews on the channels where you believe others might read them.

Even if you get a slightly bad review, do not try to hide it; on the contrary, address it professionally. If an apology is needed, then do not hesitate to apologize to the client, go the extra mile to make that person happy. Once you ensure that you have a happy client on that end, ask him to review his previous negative feedback, thus you will create a win-win situation.
