Most of the modern employee time tracking systems cover the basics. You get your employee to use his computer to open the panel, clock in or clock out and that’s it. However, what happens if your employee does not have a computer? Or if he works in the field without a possibility to bring his computer along? Or what happens if your employee simply doesn’t use a smart phone with an internet connection, which prevents him from using most of the existing time tracking systems?

**Introducing employee clocking-in via text messaging**

With NimbleSchedule, you can choose to activate this great add-on feature for a very reasonable fee (only $1.50 per user, per month) and have your employees without the computer or smart phone access clock in and out by sending an SMS/text message. No fancy computer or smart phone knowledge is required. Today everyone knows how to send an SMS message. This functionality brings time clocking closer to the companies that had challenges with more traditional methods and improves employee time and attendance tracking for all those industries where employees do not necessarily work behind an office desk with the computer.

The good news is that you do not need to active this feature for all your employees. You can select just the ones who really need this option and have everyone else use some of our other time tracking methods. Therefore, you pay just for the service you need, for the employees you need, and you do not waste your money with us.

Once you activate this service and allow your employees to clock in and out via SMS, all you need to ensure is that your employee has a 4 digit (minimum) employee ID number assigned to his/her profile and you are good to go. Your employee can easily clock in with our system by sending an SMS message to +1 858-240-5817 with a text “IN 1234” (where 1234 is your employee’s id assigned through the profile). For clocking out, your employee can send “OUT 1234” and that’s it. A simple, easy and hassle free time tracking method for you and your employees.
