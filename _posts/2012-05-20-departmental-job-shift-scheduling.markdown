### Plenty of Businesses would go Go Up In Flames without Advanced Scheduling by Department and Job Title!


![Job position scheduling](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/scheduling-software-departmental.jpg)Maria Aceves is the Human Resources chief – and default scheduling manager - for a mid-size corporate catering firm in Daly City, California. The firm pays the bills with a stable of steady clients, providing box and buffet lunches, Monday through Friday. It’s a first rate food preparation, delivery and drop off service, with set up and linens and only the occasional interruption.
Icing on the cake though, and a nightmare for Maria, is the company’s thriving dinner, special events and banquet service.

Monday through Friday. Maria is scheduling



	
  * 2-3 chefs

	
  * 2-3 cooks

	
  * 2 prep cooks

	
  * a kitchen crew of 5 people

	
  * plus 2 cleaning people

	
  * 2 drivers,

	
  * and 2 phone receptionists.


**Day to day, 9 to 5, and 6Am to 2PM schedules are the norm. But from there, things start to get more complicated.**

“Some of these people will stay on and work special events, when time allows, or when they need the money, or when the company is stretched and we really need the people. It happens all the time.”

**Though parties for up 200 people are welcome, they’re usually planned for months in advance.**

Every special event will see personnel requirements double, triple or even quadruple. “Weekends and evenings are your call, but every day there is one. We’ll have up to four or five events, sometimes, on Thursdays and Fridays.”

A relatively big, unexpected business lunch, mid-week, pays everyone a premium, but used to put an incredible strain on Maria. Getting the right workers, and keeping them informed, and coming back for more, used to require dozens of phone calls, maybe 3 hours in the middle of the day and a serious headache.

**Today, Maria is using NimbleSchedule, and coordinating everything with the party people.** The fact is, the Party People, drive Maria crazy anyway.

But the task of scheduling and bringing in this whole variety of workers has gotten a lot easier.


### **Define Departments and Job Positions and Fire Away**


With every event requiring different departments and positions, and the numbers and faces changing constantly, doing it all would be impossible without on-the-fly, coordinated online scheduling.

**Maria consults with the number of guests needed for each event and checks any special requirements.** She then punches the information into NimbleSchedule's calendaring interface. Appropriate workers from every department and for every necessary position are notified automatically. They confirm whether or not they will attend and get information on time and hours for each shift. It all happens via email and smartphone, and business is booming.

“NimbleSchedule has allowed us to really professionalize the level of skills and presentation that we have representing us, and the system is easier and faster than anything else I’ve dealt with. It’s also made my life and my job a lot easier to deal with.


### “As far as I know, all the people on my staff like the NimbleSchedule system as much as I do.”
