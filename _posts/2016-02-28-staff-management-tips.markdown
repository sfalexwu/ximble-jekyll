#### Create a strong team



While having great individuals in your team with a lot of personal success at work is great, having a well-rehearsed A-team is probably a better way to go. This is why it is so important to work on various team building techniques and have your whole company work as one fine-tuned machine for achieving success. Think of ways of improving relations between different staff members in your team and help them achieve a better synchronization in their work efforts.



#### Say “Thank You” to your staff members



Busy managers and team leads often times forget to thank their team members for their efforts. Some even think that writing a pay check at the end of the month, or once in two weeks, is a way to thank them and that’s it. But there’s more than just money involved when trying to motivate your staff and do more in the workforce management field. Make it a habit to say “Thank you” whenever your employees complete a task or project you’ve assigned to them. Consider it as a small piece of reward for their successful task completion.



#### Acknowledge and reward achievements



It goes without saying that remarkable achievements deserve special acknowledgements or rewards. If your team member, or a whole group of them, achieved extraordinary progress or success, make sure you acknowledge their work in front of everyone and point out an example of amazing work and effort. Sometimes just mentioning an employee's name in positive contexts on internal meetings may suffice. If your financials allow, reward your employees with small bonuses for their successfully completed tasks or projects.



#### Don’t forget that teams are made of individuals



Team building is definitely one of the activities that will make your company more successful. However, keep in mind that your team is made of individuals. While dedicating most of your attention to the whole team is great, make sure to address individual concerns or desires as well. Get to know your team members the best way you can, as that will help you manage your team more effectively in the future.



#### Don’t forget about FUN!



Working hard is great, and achieving success is even better; however, don’t forget to have some fun along the way. If your company is all about work, then some of your employees may become less motivated. When considering workforce management , think of ways in which your employees could have some fun as well. Throwing a company party when some milestone is achieved and celebrating success with your staff members is a good way to improve a positive team spirit in the workplace.



#### Grant breaks and vacations whenever possible



When thinking about successful staff management, you should definitely consider ensuring enough breaks and PTO days to your team members. If your employees need occasional breaks to re-focus their mind to work, then make sure you grant them whenever possible. On the other hand, if they need to take a vacation with their family or friends, encourage them to do so. By doing that, you’ll establish yourself in their minds as a boss who cares about their personal life.



#### Offer your staff opportunities to learn and grow



As your company and team grows, it may be a wise idea to offer to your staff members’ opportunities to learn and specialize for the things they care about. If there are any courses that would help your staff members to improve their work skills, then it may be a good idea to encourage them to enroll them. Also, occasional training sessions with either you directly or with some experienced team member may suffice in cases when your employees need to learn specific skills or they need some extra clarification.
