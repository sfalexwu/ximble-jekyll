In 2008, the US investor Warren Buffet, the so-called 'Wizard of Omaha', was ranked by Forbes magazine as the richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $62 billion. His philosophy to investing is as follows: "The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety".

It is in human nature to desire more. While the conventional approach teaches us that there is no money without work, the reason of which the majority of people work, there are other ways of making money. Putting your money to work for you by investing it into certain stocks or bonds is the right way to make more money.

[![Investment Methods & Techniques](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/best-investment-methods-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/best-investment-methods.jpg)


According to the conventional approach, in order to have more money, you would have to either search for a better paid job or work more hours. However, there is a limit on the number of hours you can really work per day. On the other hand, if you set yourself for too many working hours per week, you will not have that leisure to enjoy benefits that your well earned money brings to you.

Whether you decide to invest money in buying stocks, bonds, mutual funds or start your own company, the principle is similar. Investing your money in the right niche and in the right company is one of the best investment methods. Unless you wish to gamble and invest your funds somewhere blindly, there are certain investment techniques and analysis approaches that are widely used.

Let’s discuss two widely known investment approaches:
-	Fundamental style of investing
-	Technical style of investing

Many investors focus on a specific company and disregard the niche industry factors. By doing so, they do not need to have a wide knowledge or analyze the whole niche industry in order to invest. It is enough to have some common logic and analyze company’s performance. This type of investment is called the Fundamental style.

As opposed to the previously mentioned style, there are certain investors who follow the niche industry. With this kind of investment, they do not analyze performance of a specific company, but rather the whole industry performance. Although this may not sound as the most logical approach, many well known investors use this specific technique, which is called the Technical style of investing.

While both investment techniques have pros and cons, combining them whenever possible is probably one of the best investment methods, but at the same time the most time consuming one.  Depending on your general knowledge and available time to dedicate to these topics and aspects, you may use your own approach and mix and match certain aspects of all the available styles. Whether you want to look at market trends and patterns or analyze specific stocks from individual companies depends on your chosen approach.

Forming investment clubs is another approach that many people take. In order to gain more investment funds you may decide to form an investment club (or join one already formed). You can do this with a selected group of people, either your friends, co-workers, relatives or any business partners. After sorting out all legal aspects and writing down the proper Partnership Agreement you are ready to start with investments. Again, choosing the right approach is the key.

When considering taxation percentages, you will notice that governments usually favor investing as opposed to trading. If you decide to invest your money in a company for a period over 12 months, according to the US tax laws, your taxation percentage may vary between 5 - 15 % depending on certain factors. If you, for example, retain stocks for a period less than 12 months, your tax percentage on capital gain may go up to 36%.

Planning ahead in attempt to ensure your financial stability and safe retirement is up to you. With more and more countries slowly switching responsibility from themselves to individuals, it is up you to secure your peaceful future by investing your earnings in the right way.
