## ![monitoring employee activity](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/flexible-contracting.jpg)Monitoring Employee Activity and Productivity; Doing it Right


Monitoring employee activity and productivity just keeps growing in importance as business everywhere realize they've already optimized every other aspect of the workplace.

Beyond the fact that workers are the last thing you've got, they're also incredibly valuable and optimizing they're work experience is not so much a process of squeezing the last dime out of them, but to the contrary, it's a matter of making them happier and setting conditions so that they - happily - work better for you!

Spelling out to employees exactly what and why you are monitoring is vital, not only from the point of view of trust and respect, but also for legal and contractual reasons. If you plan to seriously revise your monitoring and revision policies, you should be talking openly with both Human Resources and with Legal to determine and understand all of the implications. Fairness, business necessity, and compliance with labor laws and union contracts are just the beginning.

Issues that do not impact your costs, reputation or productivity are, by necessity,  off-limits and need to be ignored.

Employees need to be made aware of the monitoring that's going on, understand why it's in place and probably to agree to it. Private use of workstations during work hours as well as rules on the use of social media need to be spelled but that isn't necessarily what we're looking for.


## Remember! Employee monitoring is NOT a Negative Process!


We've actually seen overall productivity numbers jump simply because management spelled out rules for use of Facebook during working hours and encouraged employees to brag about where they work. Some companies have broadly eased recruitment drives and increased worker satisfaction that easily.

More important than what NOT to do, is the process of learning what to do. Spelling out the guidelines, the company's position and that the company is looking to improve conditions and environment for all employees is the key.


## What about Privacy?


We spelled out above that all employees DO have a right to privacy. If it doesn't affect the company, then leave it alone.

The number one reason that monitoring employee activity grew the way that it did has to do with on-the-job safety.  Employee and customer/client safety issues are still the most important things to monitor, and in many cases, these kinds of issues are still the things being most heavily monitored.

In most cases, safety will still trump privacy. But beyond particularly dangerous practices or equipment, there are still ways to improve your work place.

### Telephones





Call monitoring can result in far better results across the organization. Beyond informing employees of what you are monitoring, it's time to take a look at the performance of your best telephone people too.

### Video Surveillance





Video monitoring began out of concerns over safety, more than anything else. But video can and should be used to monitor the overall flow and feel of your workplace too. Look at who talks to who, from the point of view of productivity and

### Computer & Email Monitoring





Far more than simply learning what not to do, computer and email monitoring solutions allow employers to really understand how their best people are doing it. In some cases, you'll find employees who have your message down far better than your marketing department does. You may even find some hidden truths that can be shared with all of your staff.

Remember, far more than just catching the bad guys, today's workplace monitoring is aimed at catching the good guys. Doing more of whatever they're doing allows your entire operation to grow while your best performers lead the way!
