To make the scheduling process much easier, our engineers developed a “**Copy To Next Week**” feature designed to help managers and schedulers create, copy or manipulate shift schedules.

When your shifts frequently start and end at different times for different sets of employees, creating some kind of a weekly schedule template that would repeat or copy the same set of shifts can come in handy. Similarly, when a company has a pretty similar work schedule which repeats from week to week, then having some easy to use functionality that will allow schedule syncs from one week to another would be extremely helpful.

<blockquote>_**A note of caution: When copying a schedule from one week to another, any existing schedule in the week where you are copying over the new schedule will be replaced with the new schedule. **_</blockquote>


If you need to save some of those existing shifts, then we strongly advise you to either save those shifts as a **weekly schedule template** so that you could re-apply them later on when you copy the schedule from the previous week, or to try to remember which shifts you need to re-create later on, in case you are dealing with just a couple of shifts.
