NimbleSchedule features many useful reports that help you stay on top of your labor productivity as well as your staffing costs. In case you use both the scheduling and the time clock component of our system, then there is one particularly useful report in our "Miscellaneous" section called “Scheduled vs Actual Hours Worked”.

As its name suggests, this report allows you to have a clear comparison of the time scheduled for your employees versus the time they were clocked-in using our Time Clock functionality. As with every report in our system, there’s a filter on top of this report. Using the filter on top of the page, you can refine your search and restrict the report to a specific date range, or simply cover the current week or the current month.

Once you have selected a proper date range, simply click on the “Generate” button and your employee names along with the data appear in the table below. You’ll notice that the first thing you see in the table on the left are actually employee names, followed by the date of their shift. From left to right, you’ll see Total Scheduled Hours, Total Hours (from time clock), Difference (scheduled vs actual hours worked), Labor Cost scheduled and, finally, Labor cost (actual).

**Total Scheduled Hours** – this column will show the number of hours for which your employee was scheduled for a particular date. So, in case your employee was scheduled to work from 9AM to 5PM, this column will show 8 hours.

**Total Hours (from time clock)** – as opposed to the above-mentioned column, this column refers to the time clock entry and will display the exact number of hours for a selected date when your employee was clocked-in. So, if your employee was clocked in from 10AM to 5PM, then the number in this column should simply show 7 hours.

**Difference (scheduled vs actual hours worked)** – as the name suggests, this column will simply show the difference between the first two columns. Providing your employee was scheduled for 8 hours, but clocked in for only 7 hours, then this column will show 1 hour.

**Labor Cost (Scheduled)** – displays the cost of all scheduled hours for a shift created for your employee on a specific date. This number gets generated according to the hourly pay rate configured on your employee’s profile multiplied by the number of scheduled hours.

**Labor Cost (Actual)** – displays the cost of all clocked-in hours for your employee on a specific day. The difference from the Scheduled cost is that this multiples your employee’s pay rate with the number of hours from the time clock instead of those hours for which your employee was scheduled.

On the bottom of this table you’ll see the totals for each column. Using these data to cross-reference what was scheduled and what actually happened may help you stay on top of all your staffing costs, business productivity and you will see where exactly your money goes. Is someone clocking in for more than she/he was scheduled? Is someone consistently clocking in for less than she/he was scheduled? Detect all such cases easily by using our “Scheduled vs Actual Hours Worked” report.
