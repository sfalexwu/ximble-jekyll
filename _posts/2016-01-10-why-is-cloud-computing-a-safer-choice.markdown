The cloud software industry has tremendously advanced in the last couple of years. With more and more people and companies using various cloud services, the industry is on the rise. On the other hand, as with anything new, there is a certain level of skepticism that hinders even more companies or individuals from joining the revolution. One of the frequently mentioned concerns is security, of course. Well, in this article we’ll cover a couple of reasons why cloud use is actually safer than using the traditional desktop software.

#### Hard drive failure


With the traditional software stored on your local computer or server, there is always a risk of hard drive failure and data loss. Unless you’re a hardcore technology evangelist and you have a backup of all your data done on a daily basis, chances are pretty high that you use a single hard drive to store many valuable information in your office, which can often times lead to loss due to a HDD failure.



<blockquote>With cloud computing, that risk is brought to a minimum. Serious industry players have reliable servers with multiple hard drives connected in RAID, thus allowing safer data storage. On top of that, such companies (like ours for that matter) create backups on a regular basis and are ready to restore any piece of information at any point.</blockquote>





#### Equipment failure


Aside from just dealing with hard drive failure risks, there’s other equipment involved in that equation. Such failures may not be as severe as the HDD failure since the data will be preserved on the hard drive, yet it may cause other issues as you may not be able to access your data for certain time until your computer or server is actually restored. If you’re running a business that requires access to certain software and data throughout the whole day, that’s downtime that you cannot afford to experience.



<blockquote>Using a cloud system, the risk of the equipment failure is again completely minimized. Of course, theoretically, failures may happen in the cloud company network infrastructure as well; however, keep in mind that such downtime is usually measured in minutes with the spare equipment and experts waiting to address any malfunction almost instantly.</blockquote>





#### Software failure


While the latest versions of operating systems are much more stable than those from the 1990s or early 2000s, there are still risks of OS failure which could leave you without the server or computer that you need to use on a daily basis for a certain period of time. This can also lead to a bit more complicated procedures of creating a backup of data which you may need before you re-install the OS on your machine. 



<blockquote>Such risks are non-existent with cloud computing networks. Cloud companies usually have teams of experts that monitor their server performances and are ready to react pro-actively to prevent any software failure (or hardware failure for that matter).</blockquote>





#### Equipment theft


In case your company gets robbed, you may lose your data or access to data for some time. That’s a risk that many companies cannot afford. This is why it is a much better idea to have your data safely stored in a secured cloud computing data center with surveillance and access restrictions in place.



<blockquote>These are just some overall reasons on why cloud computing should be a much safer choice to store your company, or personal information. When you take into consideration other reasons, like cheaper pricing, easier access and cloud apps handling, then it is an obvious choice which path is better.</blockquote>
