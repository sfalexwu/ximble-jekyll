Managing a company with employees across multiple locations can be challenging to even the best managers. Therefore, the following question may be posed:


<blockquote>_**How to effectively manage such employees without using tons of paper and spending hours and hours on such a process?**_</blockquote>


In case you've just discovered NimbleSchedule, then let us mention that among other features, our schedule maker offers an option that will help you manage an unlimited number of locations with your team spread across multiple locations or restricted to just one, when needed. On the other hand, if you have already started using our work schedule tool, stay tuned as there may be a couple of tweaks you’ll find very useful.

Once you start adding your locations to NimbleSchedule and you **_assign your employees to locations where you need them, you’ll notice that the schedule page will be simply filtered per location basis_**. One location at a time, you can review schedules and employees assigned to each of your locations. In the top right corner, above the schedule, you’ll notice a drop down with your different locations listed. In case you used our schedule maker with just one location, then please note that as soon as you start adding additional locations, this drop down menu will show up:

When you select another location, the page will refresh and you’ll be able to see a different group of your employees on the schedule. In case one or more of your employees work on multiple locations, then while browsing one location, you’ll be able to see their shifts from other locations as well. This tweak ensures that if you are working on the schedule for one location, you can easily take into consideration the shifts from other locations while scheduling your team.

If you need to filter out those shifts slightly better, or perhaps review all employees under a single view, do not worry – our experts thought of that as well. Using the filter menu above the schedule, you’ll have a chance to slightly refine your schedule view. We’re going to skip other options and mention just the important ones:

• **Show All Employees** – By enabling this option, your schedule view will be populated with all employees, including those from other locations. This option gives you the ability to have a master schedule function that’s extremely easy to enable or disable. A word of caution: when using this option, use it for reviewing purposes only and not for scheduling, since it shows employees from other locations and not just from the one you are looking at.

• **Show Only Shifts For Current Location** – This option allows you to hide all shifts from other locations so you can focus just on your single location. Provided that your employees work on multiple locations, you’ll find this filter option extremely useful.
