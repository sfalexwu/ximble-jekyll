If you're one of numerous users of our scheduling app, you probably already know that our engineering team pays a lot of attention to integrations with various payroll software systems. One of those payroll service providers is Gusto (formerly known as Zenpayroll). The integration between NimbleSchedule and Gusto allows automated payroll data export from our end into Gusto thus ensuring fast processing of employees’ payroll. No more hassle or complicated procedures when the payroll time comes! Our seamless integration with Gusto eliminates manual work needed to run the payroll service for any number of employees.

#### How does this payroll software integration work?



It’s very simple! If you have admin-level access to your company’s NimbleSchedule account, simply follow the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the web panel, and from there click on the “Application Integrations” link on the left side menu. From the list of available integrations, click on Gusto and the system will take you to the login form to enter your Gusto login credentials in order to authorize this synchronization. Once you do that, our system will show you a list of all your employees so you can link each of your employees' profiles with their respective profile in Gusto.

After completing those two quick initial steps and configuring everything needed, you can run a payroll report whenever you need in one step. Namely, once you're on the payroll report page, select your payroll date range and preferences. After that, click on the Action button and select Export to Gusto/Zenpayroll. Once you’ve done that, our system will display a payroll report for you. The only remaining thing for you to do is to login to your Gusto account and confirm and finalize the payroll.



#### The latest adjustment



Our engineering team made a neat little adjustment to this successful integration between NimbleSchedule and Gusto, which now allows the clients who have an account for multiple companies with Gusto to automate the payroll process for all those companies at once. Through a very simple process, as previously described, you can manage the payroll process for multiple companies at the same time and complete the whole process in a matter of minutes. 

Save your precious time by utilizing this integration, and keep both your employees and payroll manager(s) happy by providing them with tools that turn the payroll execution into an easy and smooth process.
