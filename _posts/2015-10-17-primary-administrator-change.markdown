All companies have some staffing changes occasionally. Whether the reason is because an employee or the manager left the company, got promoted to a higher role or simply his priorities shifted to other duties, from time to time different tasks need to be re-assigned to another team, member or manager. In B2B SaaS world, hence, it is extremely important to be able to meet such changes made by client companies and switch the account ownership and management to another manager or IT person.

With B2C software there simply won’t be such a requirement, because there’s rarely a reason why a person would switch his account to another person. In rare occasions when there is such a need, it is much easier to just create a different account rather than to switch it to someone else. In B2B world, things are different. This is why our engineering team and developers made this process super easy and straightforward with NimbleSchedule.

NimbleSchedule fully supports multiple administrators, managers and schedulers within the same company. However, there is only one person considered as the “Primary admin” or simply the account owner. Such a role can be easily re-assigned to another admin by the existing one.

Once the primary admin navigates to the My Account link in the top right corner of the panel and clicks on the “Company information” page on the left hand side menu, among all other options available to be adjusted, the “Primary admin” section will be displayed as well. All that needs to be done by the existing primary administrator is to select a different admin name from the drop down menu and simply save the page. From that moment the primary administrator role is being held by another admin.
