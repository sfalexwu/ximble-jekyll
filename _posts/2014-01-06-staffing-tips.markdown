## 13 Easy Staffing Tips to Make 2014 the Best Year Yet


_

Some industries are still struggling under the crush of labor shortages, dis-engaged and dispirited workers and a lack of over all productivity.

If you're losing money while the best people keep walking out the door - pay attention. These 20 tips are designed to give your best people a reason to stay and your second tier people a reason to do their best. They're cost effective and they're a lot easier to implement than costly enterprise software or any technological solutions. Keep it simple, at least for now.

**1) Internal Communications and HR Management are every day full-time jobs.** They're not going to go away so get used to them and get people on the job. (It's described below.)
****

**2) Be consistent.** Every day is enough. But skipping days here and there erodes the process and erodes your success.

**3) Variety is the Key!** Don't communicate the same things every day or even on the same day of each week (achievements - Monday, goals - Tuesday, etc.). Mix up messages every day and use a calendar to ensure that your internal communications are as varied and interesting as they can be.

**4) Calendar is a verb. **Well, we said that above. Use a calendar. Calendar everything.

**5) Know where you're going and why.  **Build a strategy. Put it on your calendar. Make it public and work towards real goals.

[**6) Internal Communication is a collaborative process**](http://hrschoolhouse.com/robinschooling/internal-communication-in-a-collaborative-world/). Be ready to listen. Be able to listen. Make sure everyone who has something to say is heard. Everyone else should be primed to communicate.

**7. Make individual goals important and clear.** Not just sales goals, but personnel development goals and educational goals too. **Keep them on the table** and you'll see how well people keep focused.

**8) Make sure leaders are addressing teams and groups - not individuals.**
This is one of the real keys to team building and interdependence.

**9) Build Respect into Your Culture.** Work toward recognizing everyone on your team so that they know that YOU KNOW - they're people with needs, aspirations and goals. Talk about all of them - frequently.

**10) Encourage all employees to eat better and drink more water.** Just imagine if your boss had told you that? Does it solve every issue in business? No, but it makes management acknowledge that all the people helping out are just that - PEOPLE!

**11) Prioritize collaboration and teamwork.** Again, not sales numbers, but problems collaboratively solved should take the lion's share of limelight.

** 12) Understand recognition.**  It's not really about celebrating the same kinds of numbers week after week. Recognize the contributions of as many team workers as possible and do it regularly.

**13) Make recognition personal.** That doesn't have to mean _public_. Probably more important are personal notes - even handwritten notes - by team leaders to the staff being recognized.

That's a lot less expensive than pay raises and it makes more sense, too. Do all of these steps and we'll return to some pointers that not only make your work place happier, but more productive too.
