Millennials, the largest generation in the US population (representing one-third of the total U.S. population in 2013), are soon to become an important engine of the economy in the decades to come. Therefore, each company owner or manager striving to keep his business successful will have to learn to adapt to a new reality shaped by this demographic group. 



<blockquote>Rigid enforcement of traditional rules and regulations that used to represent the building blocks in all successful businesses has become outdated and company leaders have been advised to rethink their expectations and demands when it meeting their workforce’s unique working style. </blockquote>

If you staff is made up of millennials, here are a couple of tips that will engage them better and retain their talent:





  1. **Keep up with the latest technological trends.** Millennials spend a significant part of their day working and playing with their iPhones, Android phones and various computer gadgets on their laptops. If you want them to work with software made ten or more years ago, your company’s work culture will become a laughing stock among your office millennials. Hence, it's an imperative to use all the latest technology tools and gadgets that will keep your millennials happy and well engaged. 



  2. **Hierarchy no longer means what it used to mean.** Deal with it! Millennials will simply not tolerate a rigid boss that yells at them or tries to set himself as being “above” anyone else in any way. Modern generations want to feel that their contribution is valued and appreciated. Try to create a flexible working environment where your employees will feel respected.



  3. **Let their voice be heard.** Modern generations value those companies where their opinions are heard and respected. Can employees in your company working on junior positions contribute when it comes to important projects or clients? Are they free to point out some problems that need to be addressed? If the answer is yes to all these questions, then your company is probably quite a cozy place for millennials to work and enjoy.



  4. **Competitive work conditions and compensations.** Millennials quite frequently review what previous or current employees have to say about a company before they actually look for a job position there. There are various online portals used for such a knowledge exchange where employees evaluate different companies regarding the work conditions and compensations, as well as many other aspects. Do your best to ace in these areas.
