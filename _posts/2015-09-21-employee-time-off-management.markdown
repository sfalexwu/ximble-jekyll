Managing your employeesâ€™ time off requests and coordinating your team's productivity accordingly can sometimes be a true challenge without the right set of tools that would help you stay organized. In order to track how many employees you have available for certain days and shifts, you definitely need an easy to use and intuitive overview panel with options to monitor, edit and approve all feature requests coming from your team members.

This is precisely where NimbleSchedule jumps in to save the day. In order to schedule your employees as needed, but at the same time avoid a situation where you would have too many employees taking their time off at the same time, NimbleSchedule may be of tremendous help. By using our automated time-off request system, your employees can easily request days off, or at least part of the day, anytime even beyond work hours. Such requests come to the manager or administrator for an approval.

When submitting a time off request, an employee can select the starting date along with the ending date and he can also enter the reason for his request. The manager will be notified about such a request and he may choose to edit it, approve or reject it. Apart from showing all the time-off request details, the system will also show any conflicting shifts with such a request, if an employee has some shifts during that time covered by the request. 

With such a mechanism, the manager can always stay on top of the scheduling process by seeing in advance which shifts will need additional coverage due to the submitted time off request. On the other hand, such time off days will be clearly visible and blocked out on the schedule for such a person. This prevents schedulers and managers from booking someone for the shift by mistake when that person is on vacation. This kind of functionality clearly saves time and money for companies by eliminating any kind of scheduling errors and conflicts and, above all, it minimizes confusion.
