Although dealing with various employee requests may sound frustrating and time consuming, with NimbleSchedule, this task is super easy and simple. Namely, through the configuration section you can define on how many days in advance your employees need to submit a specific time-off request. For example, you can set the system not to accept time-off requests if coming for the period of less than 3 days. This gives your time off managers an opportunity to set some basic time-off rules and stay on top of all your coverage needs with no hassle at all.

Once you have this option enabled, you are all set. When an employee logs in to his panel and goes to the “Requests” section, he will be able to submit a time off request form on his own. Employees can request just one part of the day off, or a full day off. Of course, multiple days in a row can be selected as well.

As soon as your employee submits a vacation request form, all the location managers will receive a notification via email and/or SMS. A manager then simply logs into the system, clicks on the “Requests” section and then to “Time-Off” and decides whether or not he wants to approve that new request. Apart from approving or rejecting new requests, all time off managers and administrators will have a chance to review previous time-off requests as well.

Next to each request, you’ll see a date range for which your employee is requesting a time off, the date when this time off request form was submitted as well as the stated reason for the request,. Additionally, you will see all the conflicting shifts that will be affected in case you decide to approve that particular time-off. So, even without looking at your employee’s schedule and looking for that specific date range, you’ll get the exact list of the scheduled shifts that will be affected. Neat, huh?

Once you approve this request, your employee may or may not receive an email or a text message notification, depending on his notification preferences setting. All affected shifts for the days when you approved the time-off for your employee will simply go to the Open Shifts area and you can have other employees apply to pick them up or simply manually re-assign them to someone else.
