One of the keys to a successful business enterprise is employee efficiency. And it all starts with organized and systematic employee scheduling. This is a crucial aspect of any business venture but, unfortunately, one that many entrepreneurs have either failed to recognize or done little about.

Some opt to use spreadsheets for this task, and up to a certain point, these can be useful in getting the basics of the job done. In the long run, though, nothing beats good employee scheduling software in providing a way to organize your workers’ schedules quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Here are the top 5 reasons why every business should make use of scheduling software for its employees.** **

**Automatic Shift Allocation**** **

In a manual scheduling process, the shift manager has to spend precious time going through a number of steps just to ensure that there are workers when and where needed. Determining the number of shifts in a given period, establishing how many people are needed per shift, getting the employees’ availability, and finally, matching all this data to come up with the final schedule are only a few of the necessary tasks that the manager or business owner has to undertake. Needless to say, such a process is tedious and prone to errors.

With the help of employee scheduling software, however, all these processes are automated - from the shift details to the allocation of hours to each employee. Even factors like employee type and pay rate are incorporated into the program so that you have a complete overview of how the employees are scheduled for a certain period, without having to go through a series of time-consuming tasks.** **

**Keep Track of Hours Worked**

One of the biggest drawbacks of manual scheduling is that it is difficult to monitor just how many hours every given employee has worked. Some may have logged in too many hours, and others too few. Worse, a number of workers may be rendering unnecessary overtime without your knowledge. This could put your actual operational costs seriously out of sync with your set budget.

The good news is that such a scenario isn’t likely to happen if scheduling software is in place. Most programs send prompt notification to the administrator if any employee is trying to log in more hours or has exceeded his allocation. And because the system also records all pertinent information regarding the schedule and the service rendered per employee, no one can dispute the accuracy of the actual hours he or she has worked per week.

**Convenient for Staff Requests**

Scheduling software also comes in handy when employees change their working days or availability from time to time. With most scheduling programs, an interface is also provided for employees to put in their requests for working (or not working) on particular days or reducing their number of hours temporarily for a day or two. Even if many employees were to do this in a given week, the software can effortlessly and automatically adjust the schedule, saving the shift manager from a major headache.

**Accessible Anytime, Anywhere**

One common feature of online employee scheduling software is that it is web-based, and therefore accessible from any internet-enabled device. This allows users to simply log in through their home computers to monitor the shifts (for managers), or to get their respective schedules (for employees). Web-based software also makes it easy for administrators to disseminate to employees any changes or updates in the schedule.

**Easy Monitoring of Next Schedule**** **

Any shift manager would know that an organized shift can be thrown into disarray if even one employee fails to turn up for work. While personal emergencies are factors that are beyond the company’s control, what is frustrating is when the worker simply “forgets” his schedule. With online scheduling software, however, the chances of an employee forgetting are drastically reduced because he can easily check when he will be working next. Some scheduling systems even take it a step further and automatically send an [email reminder](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/employee-shift-reminders/) to the employee a few hours before his scheduled shift begins.

As you can see, employee scheduling software is a valuable tool for any business that wants to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and free up valuable time - time that can be used instead on growing the business.
