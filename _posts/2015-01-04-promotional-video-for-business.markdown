If you are about to start creating a promo video for your start-up company, there are a couple of useful tips that might help you save a lot of time and headaches. No matter if you are running a B2B or B2C type of business, most of the rules on how to create a promotional video are pretty much the same.

**Spend time on building a quality script.** Even if you are hiring another company or a professional to make a video for you, it would be desirable to have a prepared script with the key points and values you wish to present to your audience. There is always room for adjustments later on but at least have a rough version of it.

**Know your targeted audience.** It is not all the same if you are targeting company managers for some accounting software or housewives for a new cleaning detergent. Hence, your tone, presentation style and material must be adjusted to your business audience.

**Include the content of best quality.** The material with which you are about to start your project must be of supreme quality so make sure that the content is closest to perfect as much as possible. Having low resolution images, or amateurish video footages will definitely decrease the value of your promo video no matter how good your editing or voice over is good.

**Double check the content’s copyright.** If you want to use materials from various stock markets or online resources, make sure that their license agreements are in place and that they allow you to use the content in the way you intend. The best option is always to record your own material, fresh and original that no one else used anywhere else. This will give your video a unique look and feel.

**Introduce and go straight to the point.** Don’t try to tell long stories or bother your audience with technical explanations. Your promo video should not be longer than a couple of minutes and you should highlight just some of the best features or functionalities of your product or service. If you must use text, then try to keep it short and focus on some catchphrases. 

**Do not forget to call to action!** Although it might seem logical that someone who liked your video will follow-up by visiting your website, Facebook page or Twitter account, that might not be always the case. Make sure to always include a call to action and give some key information to the viewer. In case you would prefer your audience to visit your website, then clearly write the address of your website. 

**Keep your working version safe for future re-use.** It might seem needless to keep all working versions and files once you have your video done and published, but you never know when you might need that video slightly changed in the future. During some holidays you can decide to build a custom tailored video with special promo actions or discounts, and that’s exactly when you may want to re-use your old video and just edit certain parts of it. By changing a couple of scenes, or adding different background music your video will look fresh new.

**Take your new promo video for the test drive.** If possible, the best way would be to have a couple of volunteers from your current client base or other objective people watch your video and write down their observations. Even if you are 100% satisfied with your new promo video, this might be very useful to determine how others perceive your business through the eyes of your new video.

**Promote! Promote! Promote!** Keep in mind that company promo videos will hardly spread out by themselves. If you want your new video to reach to the widest possible audience, then do not hesitate to promote your new content in the best possible ways. Post it on Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, your company’s website or blog, and anywhere else where you can.
