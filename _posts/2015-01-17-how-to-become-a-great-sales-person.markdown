One of the best ways to survive in today's economy is to be the best at what you do. While it is not that easy to explain how to become the best salesperson, obviously there are certain things that differentiate a great from a mediocre salesman. Here are some tips and tricks you can use to improve your skills and join the club of the most successful salesmen in your company.

**Observe first.** Do not go straight to your well-rehearsed selling story. Try to listen to prospects' needs first and understand what exactly is that they need. Let them clarify what their expectations regarding the product or the service are and what they would like to achieve. By grasping their needs better, you can re-adjust your approach and explain some of the gains the client will get with your product or service that they actually need.

**Show yourself as a trustworthy person.** Even though you might be tempted to upsell your product, you should be careful at start and position yourself as an honest  seller whose primary goal is to make the client happy and then, on the second place, to make a sale. If someone doesn’t trust you, you will definitely not make a sale. Hence, take some time to build yourself as an honest and reliable person before switching to the sales mode.

**Be an expert in your niche.** If you sell a product or a service, be aware of what your competitors offer and at which prices. With that experience you can always compare your product with others on the market and present some of the key values of your product over your competitors based on the actual facts. Knowing technical facts about your product and the niche industry, in general, is a big plus and it will definitely present you as a knowledgeable person in the industry. 

**Do not just try to make a sale, try to build a business.** Although making a sale might be your ultimate goal, by going the extra mile you are setting the stage to be recognized as an outstanding person to do business with and you might get some valuable recommendation from your client to their friends, relatives and business associates. So, even if you do not make a sale, do your best to present yourself as a person valuable to do business in the future. 

**Anticipate objections and be ready for answers.** Be aware of all the pros and cons of your product and be ready to address some of the concerns. Always be prepared to explain to your clients why your product is more expensive than some other ones and what the benefits of your product are, especially the ones they will not get with the cheaper products. Similarly, have an answer to why your product is cheaper than others no matter how easier this question may seem.

**Deliver more than you promise.** If you made some promises during the sales process, make sure you fulfill them. If possible, go even an extra step and provide a customer with more than you have promised. This is something that will turn your one time purchase client into a loyal returning customer. With an army of loyal customers buzzing about your company, your business will be rocketed into the stars.

**Always try to follow up!** If you made a sale, that’s not the reason to forget about the client. Nourish your relationships with your past clients and keep the connection alive, whenever possible. In case you have contact details of your clients, then make sure to follow up after making a sale and confirm that they are happy and satisfied with their purchase. Turn your happy clients into returning customers by going the extra mile and showing some extra care.
