Web seminars, or shortly called webinars, are a modern tool used by a lot of companies for holding online conferences or for training. Especially popular in the software industry, webinars can be used to present your software to the audience by sharing your screen at the same time showing your product and communicating with one or more of your potential clients without having to travel somewhere, rent a presentation room or office or waste your precious time on traveling.

A webinar is a powerful tool in the hands of an experienced sales agent, especially in situations when they have an interesting party for their product. An agent can use the web conference tools to share his screen, show off the product by highlighting the best characteristics and features and gain a prospective clientâ€™s trust. 

One of frequently mentioned benefits of using webinar tools is the re-usability of such recorded content. You can use previously recorded webinars to post on your website for other potential customers to watch and listen to, or to share them with your new employees as part of their training process.

Usually, in order for a potential client to request a webinar, they need to fill out a form on the website and select a preferred time. If a person made an effort to do that, we can easily assume that they are very interested and in need of a product like the one you offer. Having an opportunity to present all your product characteristics to that prospect is a huge benefit for an experienced sales person, especially when knowing that they are definitely in need of such a product or service.

One big advantage of a webinar use is that you can actually show your product or video to an interested party, instead of just telling them about it. Now the client has an opportunity to see the product he is buying instead of just having to visualize it in his head.

Another huge benefit of using a webinar is that it saves you a lot of time. You no longer need to travel across the country to hold a seminar for some big company. All you need is a good Internet connection and proper webinar software and you can line up even a couple of webinars in a row and gain maximum effect with multiple clients.

When using such tools keep in mind that not all your potential customers are technical experts. So give them some time or guidance on how to install proper software on their end in order to join you on that webinar. With some of those most popular webinar tools, this process is made super easy, even for non-techy individuals, so all you are left with is to send a reminder to your prospective client about your online meeting a couple of minutes before it starts and you are good to go.

As with any other means of communication, it is important to prepare well. The better you know your prospect, the higher the chances are you will win that sale. So try to communicate their needs before the webinar so you could prepare yourself more appropriately and focus on their specific issues or questions and how your product would help them overcome them.

During the webinar give your audience a chance to ask questions or state if they are slightly overwhelmed. If you start hearing such complaints, then the best idea would probably be to split one big webinar into a series of shorter ones, covering specific topics in each. This method may help the client focus better, prepare, and it may give them some time to contemplate on what they previously saw and heard.

Although we have mentioned some of the webinar best practices, we will not single out any specific webinar software in this article; however, there are many useful ones out there to try out. Depending on your product and industry niche, you may find some of those tools more or less productive for your specific case. We encourage you to try a couple of different ones and find a perfect fit for you and your sales team. Happy selling!
