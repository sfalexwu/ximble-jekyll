After a hard day at work there is no better reward for anyone than some relaxation time. Getting rid of stress may be a bit harder than it sounds, so you have to create a stress-free atmosphere for yourself. There are many ways you can do that, but here we will try to propose a couple of ways of relaxing after work that really work.

Read a good book. This may be one of the most relaxing ways to unwind after a long day at work. By reading a book you will get your thoughts off your work and other stressful things and focus on the book itself. 

A long and hot bath. Fill in your bathtub with warm water, light up some candles and dive in. Let all your worries go away. This is one of the most popular and best ways to get rid of stress. Let the hot water and a nice candle scent take you somewhere far away.

Watch TV or listen to music. This is definitely another popular way of relaxing after work. Kick back, open a can of soda or beer and watch TV or listen to some relaxing music. The choice of program is relevant so you may want to avoid heavy emotional topics or politics, and watch some comedy or even cartoon shows.

Get a massage. This is a perfect way to get all your muscles relaxed and properly treated. Schedule a massage in one of those nice places for 30-60 minutes and enjoy while it lasts. Your muscles and the whole body carry that stress, so what could be a better way to relax? Take massages as often as you can.

Nice dinner and good wine. Make the most of your free time and go out with your partner or friends. Enjoy some nice dinner time with people you care about with a glass of good wine. Why not making this a weekly or monthly ritual?

Get a good sleep. If you’ve been working hard for days and you have had no chance to have a good night's sleep, use your spare time for a nice nap. Bring everything you might need close to bed and dig in for a refreshing sleep as long as you can. There is no better way to re-energize than a good sleep.

Chill out with friends. Watching a match, telling jokes or just enjoying some relaxed chit-chat with your friends are considered to be the most relaxing after work activities. Play some music, have a couple of drinks or order fast food. The positive spirit of your friends will get you energized for the working days to come.

Take a walk through a park. Meet your friends or partner after work and take a nice relaxed walk through a local park. This method will help you relax especially if you work in front of a computer or in a stuffy office. Take a long walk, and enjoy the fresh air.

Switch off your mobile phone. Get your peace of mind for a couple of hours and do things that relax you. Cook your favorite meal or just enjoy the silence of your home. Breathe deeply and relax. Lie on the floor and put your feet up. Let your blood flow through your body.

Spend some quality time with your family. Dedicate some time to your child or to your partner. Enjoy their company. If you have a pet, then play with the pet as well, it will help you relax.

Leave your work at the office. Do not bring your office worries to home - it’s your sanctuary. Never carry out your job stress when leaving the office. Try to restrict all work related calls to business hours only, if possible.
