## Flexible Work Schedules and the Greatest Employment Advantage in the World.


**There's a lot of talk in the air about improving the engagement, attentiveness and level of professionalism among employees.**

**There's no question that employee  productivity is directly linked to employee engagement.** Employees who are worrying about their lives off the job - meeting other scheduling demands, family necessities and doctor appointments, picking up the kids from school - are guaranteed to be less productive players.

But you know as well as we do - good employees are in demand. In your place of business, at home and probably in their communities too, good employees are like that.

**Studies indicate that good, engaged and happy employees are**



	
  * Willing to stay five times longer

	
  * Working at twice the productive capacity of their unhappy peers

	
  * 90% less likely to call in sick


Any organization struggling to keep employees - and to keep them happy - should think long and hard about instituting a quick, easy and self-maintaining scheduling system.


## Flexible scheduling and employee engagement


Offering employees the ability to seriously maintain work-life balance while actually boosting productivity might sound like a fantasy from some other world.

**The fact is, NimbleSchedule does it now,** with an easy roll-out that replaces all of your paper and excel-sheet scheduling. There's nothing to post on the wall, and every employee gets a welcome email, with instructions to keep going, right from the first day its implemented.

Every manager and scheduling department employee can customize to their heart's content, so that rules are rules and they're perfect for each individual department, team or shift. However you're already breaking things down, we can do it.

But, now individual team members can, where you permit them, opt on or off of shifts. They can tell you they'll be late, and someone else can fill in the gaps. All of this can be done by email, text or internet - from anywhere.

All of your staffing is better aligned with your business demands, and shift-swapping, flexible working, and annualized hours can better be implemented. The advantages you get from clearly demonstrating to staff that the organization takes them seriously really can't be over-emphasized. Here's what else you'll do...



	
  * 


### Improve Productivity





Even complex work schedules get done in minutes.

	
  * 


### Control Payroll Costs





Since you set the rules, you're better able to control over-time while still managing dozens or even hundreds of employees

	
  * 


### Minimize Errors





Conflicts are foreseeable, easy to control, and everyone concerned gets an email. No shift goes un-staffed, or understaffed.

	
  * 


### Seriously Improve Morale





**Happier, more involved and better managed employees are what it's all about! **

All of them can feel like they're being given more control, and they're then able to better focus on their jobs, better enjoy them and still have productive, outstanding lives off the job!

Employees are managing themselves, and their schedules, to a far greater degree than ever  before, and your business is reaping the benefits.

Whether you're considering putting some real star employees on fully flex-time schedules, or your needs are simpler, with NimbleSchedule in place, you're also positioned to grow. Fully scalable, we've test run NimbleSchedule on just a few departments, and later rolled it out for an entire organization - in this case, a large hospital. Everyone from surgeons to groundskeepers could check their schedules, clock in or out and schedule a vacation from the same interface.

**NimbleSchedule is ready to make the leap. Are you?**
