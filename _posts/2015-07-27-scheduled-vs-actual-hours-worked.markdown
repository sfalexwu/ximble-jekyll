In order to run a successful business, especially when your company starts growing, an important segment of your routine has to be keeping your costs under control. It is so easy to get carried away when customers start coming your way and you start hiring new people that at one moment your staffing and other costs just go over your income. **Now that’s a serious problem.**

It seems to be a fairly straightforward process to create a work schedule and keep your scheduled costs under control. But between that point and the one when a larger team of employees start clocking in and out of the system, the difference can be huge. In no time, your carefully planned staff budget is thrown out the window and what your team actually clocked in for is way different than what was planned.


<blockquote>_**In an attempt to make staffing cost control easier for business owners and managers, our development team designed a whole set of reports and features to help along with that process. One of extremely useful reports, if you use both the scheduling and the time clock component in NimbleSchedule, is “Scheduled vs. Actual Hours Worked”.**_</blockquote>

As you can see on the screenshot above, this amazing report page will give you a detailed breakdown for each of your employees.

Here’s an explanation of each of those fields:

**• Name – Name of your employee**
**• Date – Date of an entry**
**• Total Scheduled Hours – Shows the total number of hours for which your employee was scheduled **
**• Total Hours (from time clock) – Actual number of hours on which your payroll report will be based**
**• Difference (scheduled vs actual hours worked) – Hours scheduled versus actual hours worked**
**• Labor cost (scheduled) – Through this column, you’ll see the predicted cost for the scheduled shift**
**• Labor cost (actual) – This final column on the right will show you the cost of your employee’s time clock entry**

As you can see from the description, through this labor work report you can easily monitor the difference between your planned staffing costs reflected on the schedule and what actually happened when your employees clocked in and out for their shifts:



	
  1. Who worked longer than expected?

	
  2. Who worked shorter than planned?

	
  3. Whose longer hours dramatically influenced your planned budget?


All these questions can be easily answered after a quick glance of this report.
