How great would it be if you could login to all systems you use online with the same username and password combination? If you work in an environment where various online SaaS tools are used, then we are ready to bet that you frequently struggle with some of those systems while you are trying to remember your login details for at least some of them. This is where the concept of Single Sign On roles in.



### The Concept



If you and your colleagues or employees use different cloud systems for various aspects of your business, then it is important to have all those tools listed in one place with an easy and fast way to login to each of those portals. Ideally, with one click of a mouse! Is that possible?

The Single Sign On concept allows companies to maintain their employee accounts through a single interface allowing everyone to easily manage access details across various systems. Every person that works in companies where multiple tools are used for different aspects of company needs is aware how valuable such concept is.

### The Solution



Using an SSO provider for your company needs is not so complicated as it sounds. There are various providers that support this concept and we will definitely take this opportunity to recommend one of our choices. 

There is no longer a need to remember 247 different login parameters for each of the systems you use on a daily or occasional basis. The same frustration is shared by all your colleagues and employees as well. The solution of having a unified panel from which you could allow your employees to simply click on the app you assign to them and login with just that single click of a mouse is a perfect solution. And it’s definitely not a science fiction.



### One Login



[OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) offers an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution for companies of any size or industry that allows you to organize all those cloud and on-premise apps that you and your employees use into a single portal thus making your work day much more efficient and much less frustrating and time consuming.

Through a secure interface, with only one set of login credentials, your employees can start using all important applications required for their everyday work and obligations - OneLogin takes care of signing into all your applications directly. This concept will increase your employee efficiency and productivity, reduce stress and shorten the time for each of your employees to login to any and every app they need to use during their work hours. And all this is done more securely than with traditional passwords.

Choose through a myriad of different apps, simply assign them to your application catalog and automatically provision them to your employees. Adding a new app for your employees is very easy, and they will appreciate such a time saving solution through which they can login anywhere, with a single click of their mouse.
