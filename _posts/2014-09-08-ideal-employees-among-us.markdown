Having top-quality employees in a team or an organization is one of the most desired assets. Recognizing the ideal employee in one's work environment, or being aware of the qualities of a good employee, is something that should be a goal for any corporate HR team. Although everyone is an individual, certain characteristics can be acknowledged as being common to all great workers.

1. Every worker is expected to be competent, as knowing his job is being one of the prerequisites for getting the job in the first place. In other words, we can say that possessing profound knowledge of the industry is a mandatory skill, yet not the one that differentiates a good from an ideal employee. The ideal employee is not satisfied with the knowledge alone – he is eager to enhance the already possessed skills and is willing to learn new things and techniques. Especially the ones that will help him broaden their current expertise. He follows the latest trends in the industry, either by attending seminars and workshops, or by reading trade magazines. By doing so, he becomes a more valuable member to both, their team and to their managers. And as a result, new job opportunities arise.


2. Apart from being skillful, the ideal employee is also characterized by a certain set of interpersonal skills. The ones that are in demand among most HR representatives include, but are not limited to:

• teamwork - the principle of a machine, composed of cogs and gears that make it run smoothly, can also be applied to an organization because it consists of teams, whose members are responsible for keeping that machine (company) run smoothly.

• outstanding communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and great eloquence - presenting one's thoughts in a clear manner, both in writing and speaking is a must.

• commitment, responsibility and reliability are some of the most wanted qualities of a good employee. They make a triad of the behavioral traits that relieve the manager to a great extent, helping him focus more on his tasks and not needing to constantly supervise his subordinates.

• rapport - maintaining good relationships with other co-workers, such as showing courtesy and respect as well as offering help, creates a better working atmosphere.

• punctuality - needless to say, time is money. Every employer wants his/her employees to respect the working hours. The virtue of coming to work on time and leaving at the scheduled time is highly appreciated by employers and is tacit to dedicated and committed workers.

A software solution that can help one become even a more efficient worker is called NimbleSchedule. Through a very simple and straightforward process, employees can select the position they were in charge of during a particular day or shift along with a particular job code (optional). Everything can be done via one's computer or smartphone as shown below:


Clock-in/Clock-out is a user-friendly time-attendance feature of this popular scheduling software. To start a shift, one simply logs into the NimbleSchedule account and on the page Time-Clock, clicks the Clock-in button. Indicating the end of the shift is equally easy. On the same page, one clicks the Clock-out button and, optionally, selects the position and the job code for that particular day and/or shift. If enabled by the employer (administrator), the option Shift report can be filled out by the employee.
