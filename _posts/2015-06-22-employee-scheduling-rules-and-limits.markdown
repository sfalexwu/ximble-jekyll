Managers spend lots of hours trying to satisfy employee scheduling requests. When managing a large team of professionals, this process can turn into a full day of juggling requests, leaving little time to your own job.

NimbleSchedule aims to relieve some of this unnecessary wasted time by providing tools for improving efficiency of employee scheduling. The procedure is very simple and straightforward. Namely, when you login to our schedule maker, navigate your employees’ list and click on a specific employee's name. By doing so, you can see his/her full profile. Among other things, on the left hand side, you’ll notice a small sub-menu that allows you to configure certain things just for the employee you are currently reviewing. One of those options is labeled as “Scheduling”. As soon as you click on that option, you’ll get to see a new page with additional options.

This section allows you to cap certain limits on an individual employee basis. These options include:

**• Maximum hours per week**
** • Maximum hours per day**
** • Maximum days per week**
** • Maximum shifts per day**

These four options allow you to set specific scheduling rules for each of your employees. By using these options you can easily set your employee to a limit of 30 hours per week, if needed, or 6 hours per day and make sure that all other managers and web schedulers in your company schedule your employees according to those rules.

In case you or some of your managers try to schedule an employee that will push him over his configured limits, the system will automatically warn you. Of course, if you decide to proceed and override the warning, the system will let you proceed, but you will be clearly warned that your employee is about to cross the configured limits.

If you do not need all those limits set, you can simply choose the ones you want to use and fill them out while leaving all other fields empty. Since that’s a setting on an employee basis, then you can quite easily configure completely different rules and limits for different employees.
