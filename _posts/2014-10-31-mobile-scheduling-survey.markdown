The latest trends from various industries based on hourly work show that the use of various automated scheduling solutions is in rise. With many companies competing in that market, the offer of various cloud systems and mobile scheduling apps is huge and increasing. While it is obvious from the flourish of such systems that more and more companies have started using such tools, it appeared at one point that there were no serious research surveys about what employees have to say about this.

A recent survey by [Software Advice](http://www.softwareadvice.com/), an HR & employee scheduling review organization, ([Employee Preferences for Mobile Scheduling](http://www.softwareadvice.com/hr/industryview/employee-preferences-mobile-scheduling-2014/)) showed very interesting information. The key finding of this research was that more than 55% of the surveyed hourly workers stated that they would be likely to use mobile app scheduling software in case their company started using it. Another very interesting fact was that workers of the service industry were most likely to use this type of software, whereas employees working in the manufacturing industry were the least interested ones, with high percentage of those who would be somewhat unlikely and extremely unlikely to use such a system.

These results came as a clear confirmation of what some scheduling companies already mentioned in their news and blog articles. One of the companies offering a smart phone app scheduling solution for employees along with their cloud based backend software is [NimbleSchedule](http://www.nimbleschedule.com). This prestigious scheduling software company offers a cloud based scheduling solution accessible 24/7 with addition of smart phone apps through which employees can access their schedule at any time they want. With various notifications about incoming shifts or published schedules, this software company appears to be right on spot with the results of the Software Advice's survey results.

Namely, one of the top features employees pointed out they would love to see within that mobile [scheduling app](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/employee-scheduling-app-an-extra-layer-to-organize-your-schedule-and-data/) was a time-off request section. Employees would love to have such an option on hand as they would love to be able to request days off in an easy manner, without having to call or schedule a meeting with their manager or employer.  Another very popular feature among employees is a reminder about their shifts which may lead to less late job arrivals or no-shows.

NimbleSchedule follows exactly these trends and offers such features to its users. Employees using the mobile app can easily request a time-off which automatically comes to their manager for an approval.  Once approved, they get notified via email or SMS. On top of these options, employees can also trade shifts, drop shifts or pick-up open shifts. Whenever a manager or an administrator publishes a new schedule or makes some adjustments to the existing one, employees can choose to get notified about all such changes. By using these features, employees can stay on top of their schedule and be notified properly and on time about all changes.

Since systems like NimbleSchedule utilize various notifications about shifts and shift beginning reminders, then these functionalities can drastically reduce no-show cases and increase employee productivity.  The cost of having employees frequently late or absent from work can go dramatically high without use of such systems, so it appears that systems like this offer a win-win situation for both employees and company owners. Keeping everything well organized creates a good working environment in which employees are happy, managers spend less time on scheduling tasks and have less headaches while company shareholders keep counting income and profits from such a well oiled machine.

Apart from these functionalities, NimbleSchedule offers a feature rich reporting system that makes supervision of the whole company or specific departments easy to use and monitor. This process cuts down hours spent on manually creating various reports in order to see employee productivity and cost effectiveness. Employees can configure their availabilities through the system and be scheduled for work only at times that suit them. They can communicate with their co-workers or managers through an internal messaging system and clock-in and clock-out during their work hours for accurate hourly tracking.

NimbleSchedule made all these functionalities super easy to use by developing multiple access points through a web panel, mobile website panel or smart phone apps.
