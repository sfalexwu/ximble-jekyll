At Nimble Schedule, we’re always looking to provide more efficient service for our customers. Our goal is to keep your experience headache and hassle-free—as painless as possible.

That being said, we’re excited to announce we’re teaming up with ZenPayroll to bring you even better quality and more convenient service. Customers are now able to export payroll hours directly to ZenPayroll, creating a seamless and simple process to improve your experience with both companies.

Nimble Schedule provides you with fully automated time tracking and payroll processing, letting you generate payroll reports instantly. You get complete control of who gets paid and how much for what hours. These reports can now be generated and sent instantly to ZenPayroll, enhancing your experience by saving you time. Previously, reports needed to be exported to Excel before they could be uploaded to ZenPayroll. The new integration eliminates the extra step, offering you more convenience.

ZenPayroll and Nimble Schedule are both easily accessible from any device, giving you 24/7 access to your payroll and allowing you to submit hours anytime, anywhere.

This feature is already accessible on your account and ready to put to use. If you have any questions or need help, you can reach out to our support team and we’ll be happy to help and/or take feedback on this new and exciting addition to Nimble Schedule.

We hope to continue making improvements for your convenience and usability—less headaches, better service.
