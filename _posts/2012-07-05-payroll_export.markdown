NimbleSchedule's web-based workforce management and employee scheduling software is completely integrated and operates on a centralized cloud-based platform. This means that all your business and employee data from your schedules are always available in real time. Your employees’ time cards can be taken directly from NimbleSchedule to your favorite payroll system for processing. With NimbleSchedule, you can export CSV formatted payroll data by opening  the Payroll report.

To start, go to the ‘Reports’ tab and click on the ‘Payroll’ subheading.

From here, you can select a date range using the calendar selector on the report. For example, to select a start date, click on the first day of the date range and then select the end date. Once both dates are highlighted, you're ready to go. Furthermore, you can filter the report by employee when you select one or more employees to include. In our attempt to be as adaptable as possible, we give you several options to group the report by employee or by date.

Once you're ready to run your report, you can click "Create Report" to generate the report on your screen or click the "Export to CSV" option to produce a file you can import into your payroll system.
