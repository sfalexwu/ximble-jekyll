   <title>Avoid Vacation Scheduling Headaches - 3 Ways to Stay Ahead of the Problem</title>
   <link href="/blog/avoid-vacation-scheduling-headaches-3-ways-to-stay-ahead-of-the-problem/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it—we all need a break. If you haven’t added some time off to your own calendar, you may want to take a few minutes to pencil some in. Go ahead. I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel better? I thought so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3-TIPS-ON-AVOIDING-VACATION-SCHEDULING-HEADACHES.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Avoid Vacation Scheduling Headaches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve set aside some vacation time for yourself, it’s time to consider your employees. If they haven’t requested any time off yet, you know it’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer is prime-time for vacations which, while important for employee morale (and everyone’s sanity), can be a big headache for managers trying to balance multiple vacations requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you stay ahead of the problem, and keep yourself from tearing your hair out every summer? Here are three steps you can take to stay cool and keep the office happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead.&lt;/strong&gt; Every &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/&quot;&gt;staff management&lt;/a&gt; plan should have clear vacation policies. While your employees may already have a set number of days off and a set period of time in which they must notify you prior to taking time off—you may need to add a few vacation planning guidelines to your employee scheduling policy during busy vacation times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a season that’s historically difficult when it comes to vacation scheduling, let your staff know in advance when they need to have their requests in by. If you have all your requests in advance, it’ll be much easier for you to plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to be clear about your policy either. No one wants their summer plans ruined because they didn’t understand the vacation planning policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involve your employees.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/increase-employee-engagement/&quot;&gt;keeps employees engaged&lt;/a&gt; quite like getting involved in a decision making process. So, while you’re planning ahead and clarifying the vacation planning policy, open a line of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/communicate-instantly/&quot;&gt;communication with your staff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are any of them planning a summer vacation? When are they thinking about going, and for how long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Involving your employees allows you to plan ahead and engage with them on a more personal level at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate clearly.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve already planned ahead and brought your employees into the conversation, the most important thing for you to do now is to keep the communication channels open through the vacation season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know you’ll be a little light on staff for a few weeks, make sure that the staff members who will be out communicate any important functions that need to be picked up with those still in the office. Also, make sure you’re up to date on what your staff is working on in case you need to pick up any slack or direct someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to stay positive through the vacation planning process. While vacation scheduling can be a headache for you, your staff will appreciate the break. Keep yourself sane by remembering to plan ahead, keep staff involved, and keep the communication lines open.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>4 Things You Can Do to Keep Employees Engaged Through the Summer</title>
   <link href="/blog/boosting-employee-engagement-through-the-summer/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-23T14:30:28-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/boosting-employee-engagement-through-the-summer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember summers as a kid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine long months of school culminating in three months of total freedom. No homework to worry about. No dress code. No teachers. And best of all, you probably had nothing to do all day but ride your bike and play with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of us, those were good times. Unfortunately, a three-month long summer vacation isn’t a perk that most of us get to take with us into adulthood.
Summer hasn’t lost its luster, though. Many working adults—especially those with kids—still associate summer with freedom and vacations. It’s no surprise that employee engagement and workplace productivity &lt;a href=&quot;http://officepulse.captivate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Captivate-Summer-Hours-Release-Final.pdf&quot;&gt;drops by about 20%&lt;/a&gt; during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you keep employees productive and engaged as the days get longer and the temperatures rise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/employee-engagement-during-the-summer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4 Things You Can Do Right Now to Keep Employees Engaged Through the Summer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things you can do right now to improve performance management and keep employees engaged at a time that’s often less productive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the communication channels open.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/employee-communication-tools/&quot;&gt;Good communication&lt;/a&gt; is—or should be—a foundational element in any workplace. While some of your employees may be in and out of the office with vacation, it’s important to stay in touch and keep your relationship with workers alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage vacation.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have a vacation planned? Don’t forget that your employees need one, too. While they may be trying to focus on that big project you’ve assigned, it’s still important to take a break.
Don’t let your employees turn into zombies by working all year without a vacation. Encourage your staff to take time off appropriately, rather than costing your organization time and money with low productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/team-building-tips/&quot;&gt;team building&lt;/a&gt; activities.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re not doing this already, planning and organizing team building exercises can go a long way toward boosting employee morale. 
There are lots of ways you could approach this, and some activities will be better suited to some workplaces than others. If you haven’t tried any team building activities, just try doing something around the office like a lunchtime potluck. Another great option is taking an afternoon to volunteer somewhere locally as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be flexible with staff scheduling.&lt;/strong&gt; Some of your employees may already have requested time off during the summer, but you know there’ll be some last minute requests. While you certainly want to be sensitive to your own bottom-line, the negative effects of low employee morale may take a higher toll on your organization than granting a last minute time off request.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’d rather not sit inside all summer. Your employees probably don’t want to either. So, plan ahead, loosen up the office a bit, and take advantage of the extra sunshine to boost your employee morale.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can Poor Customer Service Get Your Business In Trouble?</title>
   <link href="/blog/can-poor-customer-service-get-your-business-in-trouble/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-19T14:05:56-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/can-poor-customer-service-get-your-business-in-trouble</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Listening to compliments about your company’s customer service certainly feels nice. A pat on the back after a hard working day spent with the existing or new clients is always much appreciated. However, do not be fooled; good customer service doesn’t lead to just a couple of nice compliments that will make you feel good. There’s so much more to it than that. On the other hand, poor and underperforming customer service may significantly impair your business in many different ways. In this article, we’ll cover some of the most harmful effects of poor customer service and consequences it can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inferior-customer-support.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Good Customer Service&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;customer-retention&quot;&gt;Customer Retention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underperforming customer support can lead to serious client retention issues. Poor service will most likely cost your business some existing clients, who will just cancel the service after receiving the customer support they expected. In other words, a higher churn rate will lead your business to lower income, thus ultimately causing the shutdown of your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prospect-loss&quot;&gt;Prospect loss&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large percentage of prospects decides to just cancel their purchase or subscription to a product or service due to poor initial customer service. Even though they actually do need a service or a product offered, and they originally intended to buy it, any sort of poor customer service, or simply a lack of support may cause them to second-guess their intention to subscribe or purchase your goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reputation-damage-and-loss&quot;&gt;Reputation damage and loss&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are proponents of the idea that sometimes even bad publicity can be better than none at all. Well, perhaps it’s time to re-consider that assertation if you are one of those people. A bad experience with customer support will lead to negative comments and bad &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/the-word-of-mouth/&quot;&gt;word of mouth&lt;/a&gt;, which will not just cause you to lose some future clients you could have gained by providing good customer service, but it may also significantly affect your business’ reputation and negatively impact your company in terms of not getting more clients, not being able to hire good employees, and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;higher-employee-turnover&quot;&gt;Higher employee turnover&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no one wants to be yelled at or deal with angry clients all the time. If the provided customer service is not up to par and causes a considerable number of clients to be unhappy, that trend may cause a higher employee turnover as well. In other words, it  may become significantly harder to hire some of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/3-secrets-to-finding-great-employees/&quot;&gt;great employees&lt;/a&gt; that you keep hearing about from your friends or colleagues managing other companies. The cost of hiring and training new employees may get your business into financial trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rectifying-is-sometimes-hard&quot;&gt;Rectifying is sometimes hard&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making things right after a bad customer support experience is quite challenging. Your customer support team needs to make a dozen, if not more, positive impressions to make it up for one lousy impression they left on a client. And even if the manager gives the client a call to apologize or tries to rectify a bad experience, the bad taste will remain and make the client be extra careful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;loss-of-profit&quot;&gt;Loss of profit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s needless to say that all the previously listed things eventually lead to a loss of profit and may often times significantly hurt your business. It is because of that reason we suggest spending more time on recruiting a good customer support team and training them properly; otherwise, you might suffer some of these consequences later on. The fact that not all of the clients will immediately complain about the poor service they received is an extra reason to implement right policies regardless of the feedback you get on a daily basis. Being extra careful can’t hurt anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3 Secrets to Finding Great Employees</title>
   <link href="/blog/3-secrets-to-finding-great-employees/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-16T12:46:52-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/3-secrets-to-finding-great-employees</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Your employees are (or should be) your most valued asset. They are your brand’s face to your customers and they can make you or break you. But how do you find super star employees? Here are my 3 secrets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Current Employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s said that we tend to “keep like company” so one of the best ways to find great employees is to talk to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/ideal-employees-among-us/&quot;&gt;current great employees&lt;/a&gt;. Let them know that you’re looking for a new hire. Ask them if they have friends that would make great employees. Honest hard-working people tend to have friends with similar traits so your current employees can be a great source for prospective employees. You can even incentivize your employees to help you find good people. Offer them a cash reward for every new hire that stays. It doesn’t have to be extravagant, even something simple like a gas card shows your employees that you value their help in finding the right people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask your friends and family if they know anyone that would be a good fit. Presumably, they’ll want to help and will help you find good people. Never assume that your friends know that you need people just because you have a job posting on LinkedIn or a ‘Now Hiring’ sign in your window. Go out of your way to ask them. Let them know exactly who you’re looking for. If they don’t know of someone, they can always keep their eyes open for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/In-Hiring-a-Friend-in-Need-Is-a-Prospect-Indeed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Hire - Secrets to Finding Great Employees &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Your Eyes Peeled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know where you’re going to find your next super star. It may be in the most unlikely of places, so keep your eyes open as you go through your day. If you receive exceptional service at one of the places you frequent, take note of that and ask the person if they are interested in applying for a position. You may even want to hire your Uber driver (I found a great intern that way)! Using websites like LinkedIn and asking connections for referrals is a great way to find a great employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build vs. Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiring employees is expensive. There is a cost for recruiting. Time and expense of training. So, whenever possible, leverage your investment. One of your best, potential places for finding your next great employees is by growing and grooming one of your current “good” employees. If someone shows good initiative, cares and works hard, do what you can to cultivate them as an employee. Train them. Teach them. Groom them.  Show them that you value them. Reward them when they do well. And that doesn’t necessarily mean money. You can give them special scheduling accommodation, or give them a holiday or birthday off. The more an employee feels valued, the more likely they are to strive to do more. 
Your employees are your life blood. It’s hard to find truly great workers, and in order to do so, you may have to think outside the box a bit. Once you find them, do everything you can to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/5-secrets-to-keep-your-best-employees/&quot;&gt;keep them&lt;/a&gt;.  Whether you find them, grow them, or take them from your competitors, you need to invest in them and challenge them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your tips for finding great employees? We’d love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don’t Rely on Fate - Get Technology to Help Your Startup</title>
   <link href="/blog/dont-rely-on-fate-get-technology-to-help-your-startup/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-12T12:30:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dont-rely-on-fate-get-technology-to-help-your-startup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a world of self-driving cars and virtual reality technology, there are no excuses for still using a corkboard as your primary way of planning and organizing your business. There are so many other ways in which you can apply the latest technology, cloud-based or not, to help your business thrive. A variety of tools and systems being widely used nowadays makes this process simple and smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the latest technologies can help you manage your staffing procedures with less headaches. Numerous cloud platforms available on the market allow you to easily seek for, hire and manage your workforce. From a myriad of HR platforms available, to cloud-based payroll systems, and all kinds of staff scheduling, time tracking, project and workforce management systems, innovative cloud technologies streamline the business management of organizations in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Cut-that-Excel-sheet-in-half.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Workforce Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the latest technologies can simplify the way you track your clients and improve communication with them, as well as  collect valuable feedback and ratings from them. Unless you’ve made a decision to run your business by blindly guessing what your clients think about your existing operations, or what their exact needs are, then such platforms can radically help you improve your product or service by collecting valuable information and communicating effectively with your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll cover some of the technologies you can put in place to do the job for you and help you manage various aspects of your business related primarily to staff management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employee-management&quot;&gt;Employee Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hr&quot;&gt;HR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern HR platforms available on the market today allow you to easily onboard new staff members and even automate their training process. Gathering required paperwork in a digital form is a part of all the modern &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/perks-of-cloud-hr-management-technology/&quot;&gt;HR platforms&lt;/a&gt; in the market. You can freely say ‘Goodbye’ to all the paperwork stored around your offices and host everything safely in the cloud. Managing your employees’ PTO and accrual records is also a piece of cake with cloud-based HR systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scheduling&quot;&gt;Scheduling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storing your staff’s schedule on various excel spreadsheet files or, god forbid, on a bulletin board in your corporate hallway is part of the past. The robustness of cloud-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;staff scheduling&lt;/a&gt; apps allows you to easily manage any kind of scheduling needs, while automatically checking for any kind of shift or time off related conflicts. Such platforms simply allow you to cut down on time needed to dedicate to the scheduling process and focus your time and efforts on more valuable aspects of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tasks-and-projects&quot;&gt;Tasks and Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich online task and project management platforms allow your team members to stay on track with various projects being done around the same time. While such systems allow your employees to easily access all the data needed for specific projects or assignments, at any time of the day or night, or stay in the loop with collaborative progress and updates, they also ensure efficient team management in order to help your team focus their efforts in terms of meeting deadlines and completing their assignments and tasks. From software projects to any other kind of planning and organizing, cloud-based project management platforms are a must for any larger organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;time-tracking&quot;&gt;Time Tracking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud-based technology enables company owners and managers to effectively and accurately track their workforce attendance. In order to help various businesses stay on top of all sorts of compliances, modern cloud-based time tracking software can display employees’ effective work time at any time of the day, accurate down to the number of seconds monitored. With such a technology on hand, you can finally stop dealing with complicated time card systems or half-manual processes, and start utilizing cloud-based time tracking systems to do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;payroll&quot;&gt;Payroll&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executing payroll on time, and delivering your staff’s wages to their bank accounts on time is a big thing in any organization. Delays in cutting paychecks can cause unnecessary distractions from the work focus and goals, not to mention unpleasant conversations and mumbles in your company hallways. With a variety of cloud-based payroll systems, there’s just no excuse not to put one of them into work. Furthermore, these platforms will even help you to easily manage various policies and regulations, such as overtime, and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your favorite cloud-based software and how well does it help you run your startup?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Secrets to Keep Your Best Employees</title>
   <link href="/blog/5-secrets-to-keep-your-best-employees/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-10T09:00:42-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/5-secrets-to-keep-your-best-employees</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Employee turnover isn’t just expensive; it can jeopardize your entire organization’s operations. So how do you keep your best and brightest from walking out the door? There are a lot of little things that you can do to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/keep-employees-happy/&quot;&gt;keep your employees happy&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few secrets to add to your arsenal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;be-accommodating&quot;&gt;Be Accommodating&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat your employees how you’d like to be treated. Show them that you care by trying to be accommodating to their needs. In the 1920s, Henry Ford implemented an employee well-being program, one of the first of its kind. He expected his front-line managers to know how their employees were doing. Were they having difficulty at home? Were their children sick? The intention of this program was not to pry into their lives but to understand how the managers could support their workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Always-treat-your-employees-exactly-as-you-want-them-to-treat-your-best-customers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5 Secrets to Reduce Employee Turnover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to be accommodating when employees ask for special considerations such as days off and vacations. Try to go the extra mile by remembering and acknowledging birthdays, work and wedding anniversaries. Just remembering these dates will help your employees to know that you care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;show-respect&quot;&gt;Show Respect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing your employees that you trust, respect and value their opinions and contributions to to the organization is key. Whenever possible ask your employees for their input and opinion. An employee who feels their opinion is valued is far more likely to stay with their employer. Remember your employees are your company’s “face to the customer” and, as such, they can provide you with valuable insights about what customers want and need. They can provide valuable input on how you can improve operationally. If an employee does provide you with valuable insights and suggestions, acknowledge it and if possible reward it. You’d be surprised how a little gesture like a gift card from the local coffee shop can mean to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-let-them-down&quot;&gt;Don’t Let Them Down&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one may seem intuitive and seem like common sense, but you’d be surprised how often employers let down their employees. It’s critically important that you keep your word to your people. If you say you’re going to do something, you should do everything within your power to fulfill that promise. Try not to blame your employees. There are times when you will be forced to “take sides” in a dispute with a customer. However expedient it may seem to do so, never shove your employees under the bus. Even when dealing with sub-par employees, you have to avoid the temptation to blame because, if your best employees see your failure to show loyalty to others, they will always wonder if you “have their back”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saying “the customer is always right” is a fallacy. Sometimes the customer is dead wrong, so don’t use this platitude on your employees. It insults their intelligence. The customer is not always right, but the customer is your organization’s raison d’etre so they deserve respect, so do your employees (especially so with your best employees).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;invest-in-your-employees&quot;&gt;Invest in Your Employees&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one may not be a “secret” but it always bears repeating. To your customer’s, your employees are your brand. As such, you need to value them like you value your business. Pay them what they are worth. Make an investment in them. This doesn’t always have to mean money. You can invest time to mentor, train and educate them. Teach them new skills. Cultivate their interests. Of course, you can only do this if you’ve taken the time to know what their interests are. Take the time to understand their career aspirations. As their employer, you’re in a unique position to help them fulfill their career goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-they-leave-matters&quot;&gt;How They Leave Matters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to earn the respect and trust of your best employees is by showing respect to former employers. Losing an employee is painful, especially when they are a good employee that you’ve invested a lot of time and attention in, but how you treat them as they leave reflects on you as an employer. As hard as it may be to see them go, you should always take the high road. Wish them well. If they’ve been a good employee, let them know they are welcome to come back. If they’re a subpar employee, let them know that you’re sorry it didn’t work out and wish them well. Offer them help if they need it. Remember, every former employee is a potential brand ambassador. Leave them with a great feeling about your brand so that they tell others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee turnover can be expensive and it can adversely impact your operations, but there are a number of small things that you can do to help retain your best employees. Some of the items I’ve mentioned are common sense, but sometimes the secret to success is exercising good, common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts? What are your secrets to keeping your best employees?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the crucial components of success when running a business is having highly engaged employees. Naturally, that’s not the only important thing in the business equation, but it certainly is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/163130/employee-engagement-drives-growth.aspx&quot;&gt;a distinguishing factor&lt;/a&gt; among competing businesses with similar products and strategies. Furthermore, high employee engagement is not only good for an organization itself but also for employees as they can significantly benefit from it by achieving higher income and getting promotions ahead of others. In this article, we’ll cover six obvious benefits any business has from highly engaged workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-only-way-to-do-great-work-is-to-love-what-you-do.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The only way to do great work is to love what you do&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased productivity&lt;/strong&gt;
It is a fact that the employees who are more enthusiastic about their job and who care about the company’s interests are more productive. Consequently, employees with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-increase-productivity/&quot;&gt;higher productivity&lt;/a&gt; complete their duties sooner than the others, at the same time achieving better results. Often times they are motivated to go the extra mile to get the job done the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced absenteeism and late arrivals&lt;/strong&gt;
Employees who are highly motivated and engaged with their job are eager to come at work because they feel good in the work environment. This significantly decreases the number of late arrivals and such staff members are less absent from work than some of their disengaged colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased satisfaction&lt;/strong&gt;
Highly engaged employees are more satisfied with their jobs, and as such, they may positively influence the whole working environment. Moreover, a positive attitude towards work and a willingness to go the extra mile to do the job the right way can have a positive impact on customer satisfaction as well. This is especially true when considering staff members working in direct relation with clients, such as customer support representatives, but the story doesn’t end there and often times extends to pretty much any role in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved retention&lt;/strong&gt;
Finding the right employee for the job can be quite a challenging task. But when you do find one, your job is not done. Keeping your superstar employees in your company is as important as finding them in the first place. That’s why it’s important to know how to motivate employees. Working with staff members on their motivation and trying to boost their engagement can significantly influence the employee retention rate as well. Highly engaged employees are satisfied with their jobs; they have more opportunities to climb the career ladder and chances for leaving the company are much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosted profitability&lt;/strong&gt;
As a result of increased productivity, higher working morale and better work results, the profitability of the company can be significantly increased as well. By boosting your employee engagement, you can influence the profitability of your business and set your company on the path of success. Highly motivated and engaged employees reduce the operating costs, not only in the area of late arrivals and absenteeism, as mentioned before, but also in terms of an ethical approach when dealing with the company’s funds and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved communication&lt;/strong&gt;
Anyone who’s worked in a team knows how important it is to maintain a high level of morale and healthy communication in the work environment. Highly engaged employees, with their higher commitment and morale, significantly improve internal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/easy-and-effective-communication-tools/&quot;&gt;team communication&lt;/a&gt;, which results in better overall team results and a more positive work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3 Things Every Franchisee Should Know From the Start</title>
   <link href="/blog/3-things-every-franchisee-should-know-from-the-start/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-02T09:52:58-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/3-things-every-franchisee-should-know-from-the-start</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-going-to-take-more&quot;&gt;It’s Going to Take More&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep! That about covers it. Whatever you think it’s going to take you in terms of money, time, effort…take that and double it. Then you’ll have a conservative idea of what you’re up against when pursuing franchise opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more established and experienced the franchiser, the better the estimate they can give you on costs involved with starting a franchise. But remember, the franchiser may not be used to dealing with your local municipality, and every city has different requirements for businesses operating within their locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to promoting, you’re going to want to pull out all the stops. Ask your friends and family to help you spread the word about your new business. Everywhere you go, look for new opportunities to spread the word about your venture. 
You’ll also likely be forgoing an income while you get started, and for the first months of operations. Starting a business requires 100% of your time and effort for an extended period of time, and you have to be “all in” if you want to hope to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3-Things-Every-Franchisee-Should-Know.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule - Minimum Number of Hours&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;your-location-is-your-brand&quot;&gt;Your Location is Your Brand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sign up for a franchise, you’re purchasing the use of the franchiser’s brand and there is tremendous value in that. But you should be mindful that “your brand” is your location. You can be opening everyone’s favorite business and be exclusive to your area, but if people don’t have a good experience at your location, they won’t be back. Your brand is built with every customer, in every transaction. While the name you’re paying for from the  franchiser may get them in the door, they won’t come back if they don’t get an experience that’s consistent with their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You invest heavily to purchase a franchise. You need to protect your investment. Win each customer’s business each time you interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;your-employees-are-your-brand-ambassadors&quot;&gt;Your Employees Are Your Brand Ambassadors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be everywhere. In order to grow your business, you have to trust your employees to grow your business. They are the first people your customers meet. They are the first impression your customer has of your brand. Hire people you can trust and pay and treat them well. They are your front line in the battle to achieve customer service excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to buy into top franchises, just know what you’re in for. Plan for long hours and some sleepless nights. The costs and effort can be great, but so can the rewards of owning your own business.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minimum Number of Hours per Week and Between Shifts</title>
   <link href="/blog/minimum-number-of-hours-per-week-and-between-shifts/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-29T11:20:11-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/minimum-number-of-hours-per-week-and-between-shifts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When being of charge of creating a work schedule for larger groups of employees, it is very important to stay on top of all kinds of scheduling rules and limitations for different staff members. Some staff members cannot work more than a certain number of hours per week, while others should not work less than a certain number of hours per week. On top of that, there could be a lot more requirements that need to be taken into consideration when creating an employees’ work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, you can easily set the following scheduling limits for each of your staff team members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The maximum number of hours per week
• The maximum number of hours per day
• The maximum number of work days per week
• The maximum number of shifts per day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As from the last update, we’ve added two new options that were frequently requested by our clients. Those new options are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The minimum number of hours per week
• The minimum number of hours between shifts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Minimum-Number-of-Hours.jpg title=&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Minimum-Number-of-Hours-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule - Minimum Number of Hours&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scheduling limitations allow you to specify certain minimums that need to be taken into consideration when creating a work schedule and easily spot any issues ahead of time, when it’s not too late to correct things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minimum-number-of-hours-per-week&quot;&gt;Minimum number of hours per week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this new setting, you can easily set the minimum number of work hours for each of your employees and have such staff members clearly highlighted on the schedule page for cases when they’re not assigned with specified number of work hours for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Minimum-number-of-hours-per-week.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule - Minimum number of hours per week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the schedule page, you’ll easily see which employees were not assigned with their minimum number of hours for the week and easily adjust the schedule for them. As you can see on the screenshot below, those employees that do not have the minimum number of work hours for the week will have an orange exclamation mark right below their name with the number of hours also highlighted in orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minimum-number-of-hours-between-shifts&quot;&gt;Minimum number of hours between shifts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this new setting option you can specify the minimum hours between two shifts for your staff members. This is customizable for each employee, so you can easily tweak such a setting with different values for employees across different states or even different countries. Besides just specifying a specific number of hours between any two shifts, you can also tweak this setting to affect only shifts on consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Minimum-number-of-hours-between-shifts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule - Minimum number of hours between shifts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it appears as a minor tweak, this kind of setting can be very beneficial to companies of all sizes. For cases when you have employees working late evening shifts, you can now have the system show you a heads up pop-up window if someone tries to book that person for an early morning shift right after working a late night shift. Of course, there could be other scenarios as well where this kind of setting might be beneficial, especially with similar rules being implemented across different countries and states as a legal requirement across various industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our engineering team continues to work on adding more features and options to the system in order to make your scheduling and staff management process easier. If you have any questions or comments about these new options that we’ve recently added to the system, please do not hesitate to contact us and let us know your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Reasons Why Customer Feedback is Important</title>
   <link href="/blog/7-reasons-why-customer-feedback-is-important/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-22T09:25:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/7-reasons-why-customer-feedback-is-important</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Customer feedback, both positive and negative, is extremely important. It helps one make better decisions, improve specific business or product aspects and boost confidence. What is certain is that successful brands nowadays do not base their success on wild guesses or pure luck. Gathering feedback from clients is an important step in order to improve many aspects of doing business. Here are some of the benefits your company can get from gathering effective feedback from your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-importance-of-customer-feedback.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Why Customer Feedback is Important&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-your-service-or-product&quot;&gt;Improve your service or product&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer feedback can help improve a product or service. Continuous gathering of your customers’ opinions and satisfaction rates of specific features or areas of your product or service can help you understand your clients’ needs better and identify hiccups or issues ahead of time. By addressing obstacles from the negative feedback collected, your business will be proactive at decreasing the churn rate and improving your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;find-your-business-advocates&quot;&gt;Find your business advocates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By collecting feedback from your customers consistently, you can easily identify who are your business advocates among your clients. Word of mouth is an important aspect of growing your business and it might be a good idea to identify who your biggest advocates are so you could pay some special attention to such clients and make them feel even more appreciated. There’s a big chance they’re already spreading a good word about your business, so an extra push in the right direction might get your company more clients based on great recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-better-decisions&quot;&gt;Make better decisions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering enhancements and new options related to the product or service improvements or upgrades, it is a far better idea to base such things on frequent customer feedback rather than guesses and assumptions. Company owners or managers are frequently tempted to make decisions based on their assumptions of what clients want. While occasionally they may get lucky, it is a much better idea to make important decisions based on the data gathered from clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improve-customer-retention&quot;&gt;Improve customer retention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, gathering feedback can help you make smart decisions about your product or service and decrease your churn rate as well as to increase the client acquisition rate. Generally, clients feel appreciated when provided with a way to express their opinion. On the other hand, gathering feedback and not utilizing the data or results found would be just a waste of time. Clients need to be know that there is someone not just asking for their feedback, but actually reading it afterwards and making sure that their opinion is valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increase-new-client-acquisition&quot;&gt;Increase new client acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great testimonials from your existing clients can significantly help the process of acquiring new clients, when used properly. Make sure, though, that you have a permission from your clients to post their positive feedback about your business through the website, social media or other public channels. Seeing an actual experience of others can significantly improve your sales rates and boost your company success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;boost-staff-morale&quot;&gt;Boost staff morale&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing that some clients truly appreciate the type of service or product sold can tremendously boost the morale of your staff members. There’s no better feeling than getting some pat on the back from the client after a hard working day. Getting such positive feedback from clients and sharing it with your team can increase their confidence and boost their overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;find-up-selling-opportunities&quot;&gt;Find up-selling opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the process of gathering continuous feedback you can easily identify the clients who are happy with your service or product. After that process, it is very easy to approach those clients with another valuable offer your company might have and boost your income through upselling the right add-on products or services to the right group of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Mistakes New Leaders Frequently Make</title>
   <link href="/blog/7-mistakes-new-leaders-frequently-make/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-15T12:55:49-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/7-mistakes-new-leaders-frequently-make</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leading a team can be a challenge, especially if you’re a new leader without developed leadership skills, as in that case, you’re pretty much doomed to make some rookie mistakes. Leadership is definitely something that can be trained and there are many things you can do in order to make yourself a better leader. In this article, we’ll cover some of the common leadership pitfalls that are to be avoided at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/leadership-skills.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leadership qualities&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trying-to-micromanage-everything&quot;&gt;Trying to micromanage everything&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good team lead, regardless of his ‘position’ or ‘title, needs to let the team members use their skills to perform their tasks the best way they can. A good leader judges by results, and not by actions that lead to those results. Different people might have different methods and processes to perform certain duties, and it is a big mistake to insist on your way with every single assignment. If you have the right set of employees, with right skills, give them freedom to do their jobs to the best of their knowledge. This does not exclude some guidance and assistance from the manager, by no means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trying-to-be-a-buddy-with-everyone&quot;&gt;Trying to be a buddy with everyone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of leader or manager that was promoted from within the team to the management position, then fitting into the role of a supervisor of ex colleagues can be quite challenging. On the other hand, trying to be a buddy with everyone, when you’re supposed to make decisions and instruct your staff members with directions on what needs to be done is a mistake. Face it: you’re now their boss or supervisor and not their buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trying-to-act-like-youre-above-everyone&quot;&gt;Trying to act like you’re above everyone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, there are leaders who make a common mistake and try to present themselves as being above everyone in the team. They may have a bigger office and a slightly more comfortable chair than others, but they’re still supposed to pitch in with ideas and work that will lead the company on the path of success. Any kind of arrogance will not be received well among staff members and may affect the overall workplace atmosphere. No matter how important your role in the company is, try to rein in your ego when talking to your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-you-need-to-know-everything&quot;&gt;Thinking you need to know everything&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a leader, you’re not expected to know everything. One might say, the more you know, the better for the overall supervision process. And it can be true because you can identify mistakes or possible issues in certain areas more easily. However, you certainly do not need to know the ins and outs of the whole business. That’s why you have team members, possessing different skills, who will contribute to the overall success. Consulting your staff members regarding areas you identify as their strengths can benefit the team. Another thing to stay away from is pretending that you DO know all. No one does, so you should avoid trying to present yourself as a “know-it-all” person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-that-fear-is-the-best-motivator&quot;&gt;Thinking that fear is the best motivator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to instill fear within your team and thinking it will help you manage your team more efficiently is a huge mistake. Nourishing a positive work environment is proven to lead to better employee performance and productivity. Not to mention that a healthy work environment boosts employee morale and makes your key people engaged and loyal. Of course, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t clearly define steps for certain actions, or for a lack of actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-that-youre-not-being-watched&quot;&gt;Thinking that you’re not being watched&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you’ve closed the door of your office, rest assured that you’re still being “watched”. Team members always look up to their leader. Every step and every word of a leader is being carefully monitored. This is why a good leader needs to radiate with confidence and self-steam. An exemplary leader also needs to practice work ethics in terms of not just being the first person to come to work and the last person to leave, but also in terms of getting down in the trenches and working alongside with employees when it’s a go time. Hiding in the office from the sights of employees won’t go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;failing-to-take-charge-when-its-time-to-take-charge&quot;&gt;Failing to take charge when it’s time to take charge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have the best possible team on hand, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t lead your team. Taking charge when it’s time to do so is a must for a good team lead. Resolving internal conflicts among employees, negotiating specific deals with clients or simply representing your company on an important event are just some of the situations in which a good leader should take charge. If you’re an introvert, you may struggle with this part of the whole “deal”, but being a “face” of your company is an important step when trying to become a true leader.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Perks of Cloud HR Management Technology</title>
   <link href="/blog/perks-of-cloud-hr-management-technology/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-08T13:05:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/perks-of-cloud-hr-management-technology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the world of fast evolving technology, it is of utmost importance to stay in the loop with various trends. These trends are, for most of the time, emerging from the latest technology inventions. An excellent example of such a technology is for sure the smart phone industry that shaped the way how numerous industries manage certain parts of their work flow. HR is no exception to that rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/perks-of-cloud-hr-technology.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Perks of Cloud HR Management Technology&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the perks of modern HR management systems and trends that will dictate how HR industry will most certainly evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobile-devices&quot;&gt;Mobile devices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the rapidly developing smart phone and tablet industry is really shaping how various industries operate nowadays. Due to extreme popularity of such devices among millennials, yet not restricted to them only, the HR software industry naturally had to follow. Modern HR platforms offer various smart phone and tablet apps that both HR managers and staff members can utilize to manage certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An employee in a modern company can now easily check his PTO status, accrual days or various documents attached to his profile. Such systems allow employees to update their important information on the go, the same way as HR management can obtain certain information in or outside the office through a range of supported devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ease-of-use&quot;&gt;Ease of use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern HR platforms are extremely easy to use when compared to various desktop systems, or, not even to mention, the old-fashioned pen and paper approach where HR departments had to store all that paperwork in folders and drawers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR software is nowadays designed with an intuitive interface that allows everyone, regardless of their IT knowledge and level, to manage the software easily and effectively. Complicated installations or configurations are also part of the past, as modern platforms usually require just a couple of steps in order for everything to be configured and ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;real-time-tracking&quot;&gt;Real time tracking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the cloud technology allows real time tracking as part of the process. This allows more accurate data to be gathered at any given time as well as a better decision making process due to up-to-date information. Certain requests or updates can be handled in a matter of minutes, allowing both employees and management to make better plans and decisions with live information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;actionable-reports&quot;&gt;Actionable reports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, various actionable reports accompany real time tracking. Implementing predictive analytic solutions was a logical step with all the information tracked through the automated system, which allows further data mining in order to predict certain trends among employees. For instance, if someone’s productivity suddenly decreased, HR management can easily predict if that means that an employee is close to quitting his job or anything similar. Such information allows the HR to act pro-actively and prevent any serious churn among the workforce, when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Building a Business by Building a Great Team</title>
   <link href="/blog/building-a-business-by-building-a-great-team/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-24T01:52:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/building-a-business-by-building-a-great-team</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many aspects you need to pay attention to when you start building your business: from having the right idea to correctly evaluating market demand and competition and finding investors. These are, however, just some of numerous factors that could crucially influence your startup success. One of the things that definitely means a lot in this process is gathering an astonishing team that will help you establish and grow your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/building-a-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Startup success - Building a Business by Building a Great Team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right team in your startup company could actually mean a difference between success and failure. Who wouldn’t like to get some assistance from people who are versatile enough to fill in multiple roles and cover as many business areas as possible, especially in the initial phase of establishing a business on the market? As almost any startup out there, chances are pretty low that you’ll have enough funds to hire experts for all the areas and departments. Having such resourceful team members in the initial phases could be extremely beneficial, as that would save a lot of money for your company since they could fill in a couple of roles at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company is pass the initial, startup phase, then having the best possible team consisting of employees that are truly willing to help you grow your business even further is an important thing. In order to gather such a team, a good team leader needs to have the right set of team management skills to keep his team happy and motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many methods a good manager or business owner could apply to keep his employees highly motivated. From some small things, like making a habit to say “Thank you” for small tasks and projects staff members successfully complete to financial bonuses and rewards, there are many ideas you could use to make your employees feel special and appreciated. Sometimes simple gestures, like mentioning someone’s name in a company meeting might be good enough to highlight someone’s effort and make him feel appreciated. Happy employees will feel motivated to contribute even more to the company’s efforts. This is completely unrelated to a company’s size and should be practiced and implemented into any sort of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly motivated employees create a highly positive working environment and ultimately influence the organization’s performance. Treating your employees with respect eventually pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While hiring, it is quite important to take some extra time to find the best match for your business’s needs. Filling a position with the first person that seems like a decent fit is probably a bad idea. You should seek further and settle down only once you’ve interviewed enough people so that you could say that your choice is indeed the best candidate. Often times seeking for a recommendation from an existing employee or a friend might be a good idea, rather than hiring some random stranger through a job post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying enough attention to the quality of people you hire can also influence the performance of others in your organization. So have in mind the next time you are about to select new team members that your whole team help you propel your business on the path of success. Hence, select them wisely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;_&quot;Employees who believe that management is concerned about them as a whole person - not just an employee - are more productive, more satisfied, more fulfilled. Satisfied employees mean satisfied customers, which leads to profitability.&quot;

   <title>A Stress-Free Entrepreneurial Life: Myth or Reality?</title>
   <link href="/blog/a-stress-free-entrepreneurial-life-myth-or-reality/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-17T09:18:07-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/a-stress-free-entrepreneurial-life-myth-or-reality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you’ve started your own business and your company is doing really well? Good job! If you were lucky enough, the business you’ve developed probably revolves around some passion or hobby you always had, and now you’re making money out of it. That’s the right way to go. However, after a while, when you put employees, clients, partners, taxes and billion other parameters in the mix, things do not always look so simple. Often times you burn the midnight oil, you’re the last person to leave the office or you try to micro-manage everything  and everybody so that all the aspects could be perfect, and soon after, your days become pretty stressful. Here and there you cut some corners and skip a few hours of sleep, you skip a meal or two, and all of a sudden, your dream is falling apart because you feel stressed and burned out. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Swamped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Segmented Work Schedule Publishing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t have to be that way!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to continue helping your business grow, you have to think about your life, as well. In other words, your health, both mental and physical, and cutting down on stress are imperatives. How will you help your company if you can’t help yourself first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll mention some of the common things you can do in order to lead a stress-free life of a successful entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-a-good-nights-sleep&quot;&gt;Get a good night’s sleep&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the night.”
William Blake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you think that sleeping a few hours less than usual gives you more time to complete some important work. And true, you do this a few times, and it seems like your day lasted a bit longer, and, consequently, you had more time to complete your important tasks and duties. However, soon after, that rare occurrence turns into a habit, and all of a sudden, you find yourself sleeping only a couple of hours every night and feeling totally exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a good night’s sleeps is really important for both your physical and mental health. You have to feel well-rested in order to come up with new ideas and make good decisions when it comes to work, or any other aspect of your life for that matter. Keep in mind that when well-rested, you will have more energy, and you’ll probably conquer some important projects and tasks more easily. Try to force yourself to have regular 7-8 hour sleep nights, whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eat-healthy-food&quot;&gt;Eat healthy food&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well”
Virginia Woolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of life where it’s so easy to find an excuse and start cutting some corners is eating healthy food. If you run a successful,  growing company, then you probably don’t have enough time to cook or shop for fresh groceries every morning in order to eat healthy for the day. For most of the time, the easiest way is to just stop by at a fast food restaurant on your way to work and solve that problem. And sure, here and there that’s acceptable, but when that becomes a habit, then your health will definitely suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to eat healthy in order to get all the important nutrients and vitamins. Therefore, make sure you always have some fruit on your table, which you can quickly grab and bite even when you’re rushing to work. Find some local stores selling fruit and healthy food, which are either close to your home or on a drive-by route to your office. In order to stay healthy, you have to eat healthy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deal-with-the-clutter&quot;&gt;Deal with the clutter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When we clear the physical clutter from our lives, we literally make way for inspiration and ‘good, orderly direction’ to enter.”
Julia Cameron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cluttered work space, or even living space, can sometimes make you feel overwhelmed. It is very easy to stop carrying about the mess on your desk when you have a lot of tasks and duties on your plate. However, having a very cluttered work or living space will make you spend more time trying to find things that you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, keep both your work and living space tidy and well organized. If you can find everything that you need in your office in the matter of seconds, you will save some precious time which you can use to deal with some on-going work issues and duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-try-to-micro-manage-everything&quot;&gt;Don’t try to micro-manage everything&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you really want to grow as an entrepreneur, you’ve got to learn to delegate.”
Richard Branson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so easy to fall into the trap of trying to micro-manage everything with an excuse that you just want everything to be perfect. Soon after, the work days become hectic on your end and you find yourself running around trying to do everyone’s job. Stress becomes your daily companion quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep your mental sanity for the moments when you really need it to make some important business decisions, you have to get rid of the micro management. On the other hand, you’re allowed to be really picky when it comes to hiring your assistants or workforce. Namely, during the hiring process, take your time to find the perfect match for your company’s needs. Once you do, it’s time to delegate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assign specific duties and tasks to your team members and supervise the overall progress. You can’t do their job and you actually shouldn’t do that. You’re paying them to do the work, so let them do it. This approach will make your day much better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;schedule-everything&quot;&gt;Schedule everything!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Scheduling down time as part of your routine is hard but worth it, personally, even professionally.”
Daniel Goleman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making all the previously mentioned things a habit is often times a challenge. What might tremendously help is formally scheduling your day for all those things in-between your work duties. Besides using your schedule for work commitments and duties, you should also start entering your personal things into the schedule. Save one of the time slots for a hobby, another one for some quality time with your family and friends, the third one for a nice walk or training in the gym, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to replace some of your personal things from the schedule with work stuff. That’s something you’ll just have to avoid doing unless completely necessary. Here and there some really important client or project may be big enough an excuse to break a rule or two, but do your best to avoid making that a recurring event.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling Software Benefits – Segmented Work Schedule Publishing</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-software-benefits/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-10T04:10:30-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-software-benefits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing larger groups of employees brings a lot of challenges for supervisors and company managers trying to run their business operations smoothly. With many different variables in the mix, the last thing they need is scheduling software that can’t be flexible enough to cope with the demand. Right? Well, for that precise reason our engineering team went the extra mile to make a schedule creation and publishing layered enough to meet various needs and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company has a separate schedule for each location or department, or you need to publish a work schedule per one position/job at a time, NimbleSchedule’s got your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/employee-schedule-publishing-software.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/employee-schedule-publishing-software-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Segmented Work Schedule Publishing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-a-work-schedule-per-location-basis&quot;&gt;Publishing a work schedule per location basis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with our software, you probably already know how well it handles separate schedules for each of your company’ locations. Namely, you can easily set your locations in our system, assign your employees to those locations and keep the schedule for each of your locations separated from one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a separate schedule for each location allows you to publish a schedule, one location at a time. There’s absolutely no need to have employees from one location notified about their schedule when it’s not ready yet, just because a manager from a different location needs to publish the schedule ahead of time. NimbleSchedule allows location managers to publish a schedule separately, altering the right group of employees only when their schedule is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-a-work-schedule-per-department-basis&quot;&gt;Publishing a work schedule per department basis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to having different teams and different managers - per location basis, some companies separate their employees into departments, and have department managers. With that in mind, our system allows the creation of schedules per department basis when using the “Departments” tab on the schedule page. On the other hand, when using the Department filter above the schedule to filter out just one specific department, the system allows publishing of a schedule for just a selected department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method allows department managers to publish their department’s schedule only when it’s ready, without forcing other departments to follow their pace with the scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-shifts-per-position-basis&quot;&gt;Publishing shifts per position basis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogously, our system also allows publishing of a schedule for each position separately. When using the Position filter option above the schedule to view each position in the system separately on the schedule page, you can click on the Publish option and publish a schedule for just a selected position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing managers to publish a schedule for one position at a time ensures a more flexible approach for large groups, where positions and jobs with a higher priority can be assigned and published first, leaving other positions and shifts for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-of-unpublished-shifts-only&quot;&gt;Publishing of unpublished shifts only&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule features various notification types that help employees stay on top of their schedule at all times. When publishing a schedule in segments, you, of course, risk notifying some of your employees more than once regarding the same shifts on the schedule. If those employees were already notified, and there was no change to their schedule, then chances are pretty high that duplicate notifications could cause occasional confusion as well. In order to avoid such scenarios, our system allows company managers to publish only an unpublished portion of a schedule and leave out those employees who already had their shifts published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach helps avoid any kind of confusion while sending out multiple schedule notifications and streamlines the whole employee scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling Essentials That Will Save Your Day</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-essentials/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-03T04:20:40-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-essentials</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the era of rapidly-developing technology, apps, gadgets and widgets have become a necessity in every day work life in order for one to stay ahead of the game. Companies use various apps and tools to increase their employees’ productivity, save time and money and stay competitive. Employees, on the other hand, seem to gladly accept new technologies which make their work life easier and more productive. From online employee scheduling tools and HR management systems to various staff management software tools, there are many different cloud and mobile apps that can help on that road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/employee-scheduling-essentials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling Essentials&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above-mentioned in mind, here’s how NimbleSchedule can effectively save time, reduce absenteeism and improve communication among managers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;repetitive-employee-scheduling&quot;&gt;Repetitive employee scheduling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff management can be quite a challenge most of the time, especially when managing a large group of employees. In such situations, managers often time appreciate any help they can get in order to speed up the process of scheduling and avoid any sort of scheduling overlaps or errors that can be quite costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your team operates on a more or less repetitive schedule basis week to week, then NimbleSchedule can help immensely with your staff scheduling procedures. With many different options and tools that allow you to repeat your workforce schedule week by week, or save the existing weeks of a schedule, which can be rotated afterwards, NimbleSchedule can help you save an average of 10 - 15 hours per week. Regardless of if you decide to use our Repeating patterns, Schedule Templates or Copy To Next Week functionalities, you’ll get your staff schedule done within a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shift-conflict-prevention&quot;&gt;Shift conflict prevention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our automated schedule maker, you’ll dramatically minimize &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/automated-conflict-checks-employee-scheduling-with-no-headaches/&quot;&gt;rostering errors and prevent any sort of conflicts&lt;/a&gt;. NimbleSchedule doesn’t allow double booking of employees when managing complicated scheduling needs across multiple locations. The system will warn the person creating the schedule that an employee is not available when the scheduler tries to add a new shift that overlaps with the existing one. Furthermore, if your employee took a part of the day off, or a couple of days off during a certain period of time, such employee will be clearly highlighted on the schedule thus preventing anyone from scheduling that person by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;labor-scheduling-self-service&quot;&gt;Labor scheduling self-service&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If needed, NimbleSchedule can allow employees to trade their shifts, drop their shifts or even find replacements for their shifts. There’s absolutely no need for a manager or a scheduler to waste hours of her or his time trying to fill the uncovered shifts. If configured in a proper way, NimbleSchedule can handle semi-automated shift replacements and trades, with the final approval coming from the manager at the end of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accurate-time-tracking&quot;&gt;Accurate time tracking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule’s  time tracking module allows companies to accurately track their workforce hours no matter how complex the requirements might be. For example, you can easily track the working hours of employees that have different pay rates, that work across different locations or need to clock in/out for their shift from remote locations, i.e. outside their office. When those traditional time clock posts fail to serve the purpose, the cloud-based technology has a lot to offer as it allows employees to clock in by using their smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, with NimbleSchedule, your employees can clock in by sending a text message, calling in, using QR Code cards or fingerprint scanners. For a full list of available time tracking options, you can check out our “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/time-tracking-software-the-place-where-accuracy-and-flexibility-meet/&quot;&gt;The Place Where Accuracy and Flexibility Meet&lt;/a&gt;” article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;staff-communication-simplified&quot;&gt;Staff communication simplified&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadcasting a message to the whole team seems like a fairly simple task - you add all the team members to the email receiver field, or to the SMS receiver and that’s it. But when they all start responding with different questions or issues, that’s where the process starts creating havoc. So one might conclude that keeping an entire team informed and empowered at all times can be quite a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, you can easily communicate with a large group of employees by broadcasting announcements or messages to all employees working in a specific location or a couple of locations, to all employees working in a certain department or a certain position. Of course, you can always custom select any employees from the list and initiate a group conversation with them. By allowing them to respond to the message thread, the manager can easily communicate with larger teams and effectively manage the team communication even without the whole team being present in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are just some of the manifold benefits of using our cloud scheduling app. There are certainly many more that we will cover in the articles to come. So stay tuned and stay Nimble!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Cutthroat Race for Better Workforce Management – How Can Cloud Technology Help</title>
   <link href="/blog/better-workforce-management/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-27T06:15:24-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/better-workforce-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With rapidly developing technology, the world of business is constantly changing. Across HR departments, the pace of changes has accelerated due to all the new technologies being implemented and millennials becoming the majority of the workforce. As it seems, the way of handling HR will rapidly change over the next 10 years in terms of challenges and workforce management techniques that need to be improved and upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cut-Throat-Race-For-Better-Workforce-Management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Race for Better Workforce Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to statistics, unemployment rates in the IT industry seem to be amongst the lowest ones. From tech support personnel, networking architects, programmers and other software engineers, the demand seems to be growing. With such a shortage of top tech talents, the salaries and hourly rates of good IT personnel are skyrocketing. Even with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/outsourcing/&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; process on the rise, with all top tech companies hiring tech experts from around the world to fill in gaps in their company positions, the challenge of finding (and keeping) the best tech talents is becoming a cutthroat game. Recruiting top talents during the years ahead of us will be one of the biggest challenges in the IT industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as we’ve already mentioned in one of our previous articles, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/4-ways-to-keep-your-office-millennials-engaged/&quot;&gt;4 Ways to Keep Your Office Millennials Engaged&lt;/a&gt;) millennial workforce has become the main engine of the US labor across all the industries. Along with such a generational change, the culture and trends have also shifted toward using the latest technologies across various aspects of modern businesses. The modern workforce wants more flexibility when it comes to their schedule hours, easy ways to check their roster, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/quick-and-efficient-shift-trading/&quot;&gt;swap shifts&lt;/a&gt;, monitor work hours or request vacation days. The number of clicks on a computer or screens that need to be touched on the smart phone are becoming units of measurement for company procedures nowadays. This trend will become even more prominent in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many traditional company operations have shifted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/cloud-technology-revolution/&quot;&gt;cloud-based technologies&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you need accounting software, employee scheduling, time tracking, payroll, HR software or anything similar related to staff management, cloud computing has a solution for you. With the development of various cloud technologies, cloud systems offering a solution for various aspects of modern business operations are everywhere. The reasons for this high demand lie in some of the things already mentioned above, but there are certainly many more. The process of simplifying and streamlining all the company operations is just a logical step. No more paperwork or old-fashioned desktop software taking a lot of time to maintain and manage. By utilizing cloud-based technology, company managers can significantly cut down on time wasted on payrolls, creating schedules or workforce management procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule Time Tracking Software – The Place Where Accuracy and Flexibility Meet</title>
   <link href="/blog/time-tracking-software-the-place-where-accuracy-and-flexibility-meet/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-14T03:20:06-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/time-tracking-software-the-place-where-accuracy-and-flexibility-meet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When a company starts to grow and staff management becomes a challenge, it’s of utmost importance to have the right set of tools to help keep that process under control. Having accurate time tracking software that can handle any number of employees’ time clocking entries while at the same time providing access to one or more managers to such data in order for them to be verified and approved is a big deal. The existing cloud time clocks provide either accuracy with very little flexibility, or just flexibility with questionable accuracy and reliability. NimbleSchedule Time Clocking, on the other hand, is a perfect middle where all those needs meet in order to help company owners and managers to stay compliant and track their employees’ hours in an accurate and reliable manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nimbleschedule-time-tracking-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule Time Tracking Software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-nimbleschedule-time-tracking-software-so-flexible&quot;&gt;Why is NimbleSchedule Time Tracking Software so Flexible?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tracking-multiple-pay-rates&quot;&gt;Tracking Multiple Pay Rates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our system, it is quite easy to track multiple positions with different pay rates for each employee. All you need to do to set this up is to assign more than one position to your employees’ profiles, and during the clock-out process, they will be presented with a choice to select one from multiple positions assigned to them. On the other hand, if you’d like to have more control over which position they clock in/out, then you can restrict them to clock in/out for just a scheduled position. By having such flexibility, you can still track multiple pay rate hours for all your employees, while at the same time minimizing any room for potential abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;easy-verification-and-approval-process&quot;&gt;Easy Verification and Approval Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your employees’ clock in and out, it is important to have simple access to such data in order to verify and approve those hours. Moreover, with our time tracking software, you’ll have a clear vision of who’s currently clocked in and from which time exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your employees are done with their shift, you can verify their notes (if they’re required to do so), their hours and the position/pay rate they covered for the day. Besides having just one manager approve all such entries, if needed, you can have more than one person approving hours for your employees’ stamps. The approval can be done manually or automatically; namely, our system features a couple of ways to mass approve your employees’ hours as well, which makes it really easy to manage your staff hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-tracking-through-different-technologies&quot;&gt;Time Tracking Through Different Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies sometimes require flexibility when it comes to ways in which their employees can leave time clock punches. Not everyone works in an office or carries a smart phone, although those are quite often the most popular technologies which are used to track employee hours.  With our staff management tool, you can use all of the following methods to track your workforce hours:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Web panel based time clock
• Smart phone app time tracking
• Tablet/iPad QR Code Time Clock App
• SMS/Text message time tracking
• Phone call-in time clock
• Biometric/Fingerprint device time clock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-rich-reporting&quot;&gt;Feature Rich Reporting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on such time clock data, you can run many different reports in our system and export them via CSV file. Aside from various actionable reports, you can also run payroll reports and either export them to customizable CSV export files or use one of our payroll partnering systems to run the actual payroll through synchronization between NimbleSchedule and many prestigious payroll systems.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling App – An Extra Layer to Organize Your Schedule and Data</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-app-an-extra-layer-to-organize-your-schedule-and-data/"/>
   <updated>2016-03-06T03:39:16-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-app-an-extra-layer-to-organize-your-schedule-and-data</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is always more than one way to create a schedule and organize your employee data in our scheduling app in order to streamline your rostering needs. Our engineering team keeps developing new functionalities which help companies and organizations segment their data thus ensuring smooth &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/&quot;&gt;staff management&lt;/a&gt; and scheduling processes. From now on, besides offering you a way to organize employee data across various locations, departments and positions, our employee scheduling app now offers you another layer that will help you out with the whole workforce management process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introducing-regions&quot;&gt;Introducing: Regions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to edit your locations, an additional field labeled as “Region Name” will now appear in the Settings section. This textual field will allow you to assign a region name to your work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/&quot;&gt;schedule maker&lt;/a&gt; environment and break down your data into more segments. Once you add your region names to all your locations, you’ll notice two new drop down menus in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regions-drop-down-menu-in-the-locations-section-of-the-settings&quot;&gt;Regions drop down menu in the Locations section of the Settings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you add regions to your locations, a new drop down menu will appear above your location names in the settings area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/regions-settings.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/regions-settings-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling App - Regions drop down menu in the Locations section of the Settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new drop down will allow you to search through all your locations or to filter out locations in one region in case you select one and press the “Search” button. By doing so, our system will filter out all the locations assigned to the region you’ve selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regions-drop-down-menu-in-the-scheduling-section&quot;&gt;Regions drop down menu in the scheduling section&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the moment you start assigning regions to your locations’ settings, you’ll notice a regions drop down menu on the scheduling page, next to your locations drop down. This new menu will make it much easier for you to look through your locations as they will be broken down into regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/regions-schedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/regions-schedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule App - Regions drop down menu in the scheduling section&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having flexibility to add additional layers to the data organization structure and scheduling app process is particularly beneficial to companies having a lot of locations that are to be supervised. Nevertheless, if you do not need regions implemented, you can simply ignore that section since our engineering team organized this new feature as completely optional.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Staff Management Tips – How to Keep Your Employees Motivated</title>
   <link href="/blog/staff-management-tips/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-28T03:30:33-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/staff-management-tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re a manager or a business owner, you probably know how hard it is to keep your staff highly motivated. One might ask why motivation in the workplace is such a big deal; the answer is pretty simple - motivated employees will love where they work, and consequently, will be ready to move mountains. That’s why we’ve selected a couple of engaging and interesting staff management techniques that will help you focus or re-focus your team and achieve success at work. In particular, we’ve selected the most common staff managing tips that will help you build a better work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/staff-management-tips.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Motivated Workforce - Staff Management Tips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;create-a-strong-team&quot;&gt;Create a strong team&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While having great individuals in your team with a lot of personal success at work is great, having a well-rehearsed A-team is probably a better way to go. This is why it is so important to work on various team building techniques and have your whole company work as one fine-tuned machine for achieving success. Think of ways of improving relations between different staff members in your team and help them achieve a better synchronization in their work efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;say-thank-you-to-your-staff-members&quot;&gt;Say “Thank You” to your staff members&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busy managers and team leads often times forget to thank their team members for their efforts. Some even think that writing a pay check at the end of the month, or once in two weeks, is a way to thank them and that’s it. But there’s more than just money involved when trying to motivate your staff and do more in the workforce management field. Make it a habit to say “Thank you” whenever your employees complete a task or project you’ve assigned to them. Consider it as a small piece of reward for their successful task completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;acknowledge-and-reward-achievements&quot;&gt;Acknowledge and reward achievements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that remarkable achievements deserve special acknowledgements or rewards. If your team member, or a whole group of them, achieved extraordinary progress or success, make sure you acknowledge their work in front of everyone and point out an example of amazing work and effort. Sometimes just mentioning an employee’s name in positive contexts on internal meetings may suffice. If your financials allow, reward your employees with small bonuses for their successfully completed tasks or projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-forget-that-teams-are-made-of-individuals&quot;&gt;Don’t forget that teams are made of individuals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team building is definitely one of the activities that will make your company more successful. However, keep in mind that your team is made of individuals. While dedicating most of your attention to the whole team is great, make sure to address individual concerns or desires as well. Get to know your team members the best way you can, as that will help you manage your team more effectively in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dont-forget-about-fun&quot;&gt;Don’t forget about FUN!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working hard is great, and achieving success is even better; however, don’t forget to have some fun along the way. If your company is all about work, then some of your employees may become less motivated. When considering workforce management , think of ways in which your employees could have some fun as well. Throwing a company party when some milestone is achieved and celebrating success with your staff members is a good way to improve a positive team spirit in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;grant-breaks-and-vacations-whenever-possible&quot;&gt;Grant breaks and vacations whenever possible&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about successful staff management, you should definitely consider ensuring enough breaks and PTO days to your team members. If your employees need occasional breaks to re-focus their mind to work, then make sure you grant them whenever possible. On the other hand, if they need to take a vacation with their family or friends, encourage them to do so. By doing that, you’ll establish yourself in their minds as a boss who cares about their personal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;offer-your-staff-opportunities-to-learn-and-grow&quot;&gt;Offer your staff opportunities to learn and grow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your company and team grows, it may be a wise idea to offer to your staff members’ opportunities to learn and specialize for the things they care about. If there are any courses that would help your staff members to improve their work skills, then it may be a good idea to encourage them to enroll them. Also, occasional training sessions with either you directly or with some experienced team member may suffice in cases when your employees need to learn specific skills or they need some extra clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gusto Payroll Software Integration Adjustment – Payroll Service Done Easily</title>
   <link href="/blog/gusto-payroll-software-integration-adjustment-payroll-service-done-easily/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-21T05:20:34-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/gusto-payroll-software-integration-adjustment-payroll-service-done-easily</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of numerous users of our scheduling app, you probably already know that our engineering team pays a lot of attention to integrations with various payroll software systems. One of those payroll service providers is Gusto (formerly known as Zenpayroll). The integration between NimbleSchedule and Gusto allows automated payroll data export from our end into Gusto thus ensuring fast processing of employees’ payroll. No more hassle or complicated procedures when the payroll time comes! Our seamless integration with Gusto eliminates manual work needed to run the payroll service for any number of employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NimbleSchedule-and-Gusto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gust and NimbleSchedule - Payroll Service Done Easily&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-does-this-payroll-software-integration-work&quot;&gt;How does this payroll software integration work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very simple! If you have admin-level access to your company’s NimbleSchedule account, simply follow the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the web panel, and from there click on the “Application Integrations” link on the left side menu. From the list of available integrations, click on Gusto and the system will take you to the login form to enter your Gusto login credentials in order to authorize this synchronization. Once you do that, our system will show you a list of all your employees so you can link each of your employees’ profiles with their respective profile in Gusto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Payroll-Service-Integration.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Payroll-Service-Integration-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gusto Payroll Software Integration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing those two quick initial steps and configuring everything needed, you can run a payroll report whenever you need in one step. Namely, once you’re on the payroll report page, select your payroll date range and preferences. After that, click on the Action button and select Export to Gusto/Zenpayroll. Once you’ve done that, our system will display a payroll report for you. The only remaining thing for you to do is to login to your Gusto account and confirm and finalize the payroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-latest-adjustment&quot;&gt;The latest adjustment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our engineering team made a neat little adjustment to this successful integration between NimbleSchedule and Gusto, which now allows the clients who have an account for multiple companies with Gusto to automate the payroll process for all those companies at once. Through a very simple process, as previously described, you can manage the payroll process for multiple companies at the same time and complete the whole process in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your precious time by utilizing this integration, and keep both your employees and payroll manager(s) happy by providing them with tools that turn the payroll execution into an easy and smooth process.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule's QR Code Reader - Now Available Free of Charge</title>
   <link href="/blog/nimbleschedules-qr-code-reader-now-available-free-of-charge/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-13T03:30:11-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/nimbleschedules-qr-code-reader-now-available-free-of-charge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to handling employee time tracking, NimbleSchedule’s clients know they have many ways to choose from. Our time tracking software allows companies of different sizes to find the best method for their industry niche and specific needs. Apart from offering many different methods for employee time tracking, we also ensure the flexibility of the software itself, as it allows the use of multiple time tracking methods at once, depending on the need, event or employee skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NimbleSchedules-QRCode-Reader.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Tracking Software - Free QR Code Reader&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular methods of employee time tracking is using the QR Code and NimbleSchedule’s Time Clock app for iPads and Android tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a manager, all you need to do is print out QR Code cards for your employees and have a dedicated Android tablet or iPad positioned on a handy place in your company. Your employees, on the other hand, use their printed QR Code cards to clock in and/or out. The process is like this: an employee simply approaches the tablet or iPad and flashes their QR Code. The system automatically logs in the user and displays either the Clock IN or Clock OUT button in the middle of the screen. When an employee clocks in/out, the system handles that task and immediately shows the initial screen for the next employee to flash the QR Code card in order to clock in or out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-the-good-news&quot;&gt;What’s the good news?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that our QR Code Time Clock app is now completely &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Regardless of if you use an iPad or Android tablet, you can download our free Time Clock app onto your device and start using it right away. When it comes to the actual QR Codes, you can find your employees’ QR codes via Reports page. Once there, click on the Employees sub-section, and then simply select the QR Code report. The location of this report is highlighted on the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QR-Codes-report.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/QR-Codes-report-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule QR Codes Report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case an employee forgets to bring their QR Card to work, there’s also an option to have your employee login in by using the username and password. Moreover, our standard smart phone app has an option to generate a QR Code on the fly for any of your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more great news from NimbleSchedule!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Time Tracking Software Perk - Mass Editing of Employees’ Timesheets</title>
   <link href="/blog/new-time-tracking-software-perk-mass-editing-of-employees-timesheets/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-07T03:47:56-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/new-time-tracking-software-perk-mass-editing-of-employees-timesheets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to make our time tracking software more flexible for employee’ records management, our engineering team implemented a new feature called “Mass Editing” into our staff management system. This new mass editing feature allows streamlined management of a large amount of records in an easy to use procedure and it simplifies the use of our web based time tracking software. If you’re already our client, then you’re probably aware of our “Approve All” feature which allows mass approval of employee time tracking records in our system. On top of that feature, we now have a whole set of fields that can be mass edited or altered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/timesheets-mass-edit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/timesheets-mass-edit-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mass Edit Feature - Time Tracking Software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you visit the “Timesheets” page, on the far right of each timesheet record, you’ll notice a new check-box displayed. Above the list, and below the “Approve All” button, you’ll notice two new buttons that allow you to mass select or edit selected records. Aside from using the mass select feature, you can also use those check-boxes to manually select the exact records you wish to edit. Within the mass selection menu, you’ll have a chance to select:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• All – Allows you to automatically select all records shown on the page
• None – Allows you to automatically deselect all the selected records
• Approved – Allows you to select all approved records on the page
• Un-Approved – Allows you to select all approval-pending records on the page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/timesheet-mass-selection.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/timesheet-mass-selection-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mass Selection - Timesheets Mass Edit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve selected records that you wish to mass edit, you can proceed by clicking on the pencil/edit icon next to the mass selection tool. As soon as you click on that icon, a popup will show up and it will present you with some options that will help you edit the selected timesheets. The fields you’ll have a chance to mass edit are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Job Code
• Approval status
• Position
• Department
• Location&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/timesheets-mass-edit-popup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/timesheets-mass-edit-popup-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mass Edit Popup - Bulk Edit Timesheet Fields&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can skip any of the fields you wish to leave unchanged and select those you wish to alter. When you select the desired change from the drop down menus, click the “Update” button and that’s it. All records you’ve previously selected will be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no need for manual editing of one record at a time anymore. You can easily select a whole group of records through our time tracking software and commit a change through a single popup dialog. A piece of cake, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more great updates!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While creating NimbleSchedule, our engineering team implemented multiple ways to handle specific tasks related to work schedule management. Namely, different companies have different &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/&quot;&gt;staff management&lt;/a&gt; requirements. This is why it was very important for our team to ensure flexibility when it comes to our online schedule maker in order to allow different business niches to use our system with ease. With that said, here are a couple possible methods for you to roster your employees through our online shift planning software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-simplest-approach-for-shift-planning---the-shift-creation-popup&quot;&gt;The Simplest Approach for Shift Planning –  the Shift Creation Popup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the-shift-popup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/the-shift-popup-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Shift Creation Popup - Schedule Maker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to quickly schedule any of your employees for a given day and given time is to simply navigate to that specific day through our shift planner and click on the right day for the right employee. Once you do that, a popup window will show, like the one shown on the screenshot above, allowing you to set various parameters. The mandatory fields are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Position – Allows you to select one of the available positions for which your employee is allowed to work
• Department (in case your company uses this feature) – Allows you to select the department for your new shift
• Start time and End time – This is where you set the time slot of your employee’s shift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from these mandatory fields, you’ll also have a chance to enter a shift label and shift tasks/notes, as well as to choose a repeating pattern, in case you wish to repeat that specific shift for a couple of days or weeks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, through this popup window you can also edit the shift data. Once you click on an already created shift, you’ll be prompted to edit the details. Besides just editing the information, you can also choose to delete the shift you’re editing or to send it to Open Shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-advanced-work-schedule-maker-option--the-create-shifts-menu&quot;&gt;The Advanced Work Schedule Maker Option – The “Create Shifts” Menu&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/create-shifts.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/create-shifts-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The &#39;Create Shifts&#39; Menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit more advanced approach to the multiple shifts creation, you can use the “Create Shifts” menu above the schedule. First, select the position needed. Once you do that, the system will show you a list of employees eligible to work in that position. From the list of available staff members, you can select more than one person that needs to be rostered for the shift during a specific week. When you’ve selected employees needed to be scheduled, you can complete some basics on the left, like the shift start time, end time and optional notes. You can also choose to repeat such block of shifts for a couple of weeks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from selecting these shift basics, you can also choose the days of the week for this new shift. This approach allows you to bulk create a set of shifts for multiple days in a week, and possibly multiple employees as well, through a single process menu. This method allows you to spend  less time on your staff schedule management and focus more on important aspects of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-import-feature-for-power-users&quot;&gt;The “Import” Feature For Power Users&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/import-schedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/import-schedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The &#39;Schedule Import&#39; Feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from already mentioned features, our system allows clients to import their schedule by using the Excel or CSV file format. In case you already have your staff schedule pre-created or exported from another system, you can easily import it into NimbleSchedule and save yourself from hours of manual work you would usually spend to create a new roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of repeating all the steps needed to complete the schedule import process, I’ll rather direct you to our amazing support article covering this topic with exact instructions on how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.nimbleschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/202707603-Schedule-Import&quot;&gt;Import Schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Syncing Your Work Schedule with Google Calendar</title>
   <link href="/blog/syncing-your-work-schedule-with-google-calendar/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-23T04:44:13-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/syncing-your-work-schedule-with-google-calendar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In mid-2015, Google reported that their Gmail service was used by more than 900 million users, which is more than double the number reported back in 2012. Various Google’s tools and products are yet to be fully leveraged in the years to come. This is why our team has implemented a couple of options along the way to make the usage of our online scheduler even easier for all Google/Gmail fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from using Google credentials to login to our online schedule maker, there is another handy feature implemented into our system with the aim to make everyone’s work life a bit easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing: &lt;em&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/em&gt; sync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an employee level user in NimbleSchedule, you will find Google Calendar sync extremely useful. Namely, the system will immediately sync your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/&quot;&gt;work schedule&lt;/a&gt; from NimbleSchedule into Google Calendar the moment it gets created. Depending on whether you check your Google Calendar on your computer or your Android/iPhone, such data will be instantly available on your end. If you’re a manager or an admin level user in our system, you’ll also be able to sync your personal schedule with Google Cal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to setup this integration, all you need to do is to login to the system and navigate to the My Schedule page - if you’re the manager, or simply click on the Schedules tab - if you’re an employee. On that page, you’ll notice a couple of options in the top left corner above the schedule, which will allow you to sync your work shifts with a couple of different systems, as shown on the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Google-Calendar-Connect.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Google-Calendar-Connect-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Work Schedule - Google Calendar Connect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to connect your personal work schedule with Google Calendar, just click on the G icon shown on the screenshot above, and the system will take you to Google. If you’re already logged in to your Gmail account, Google will simply ask you to accept and confirm this synchronization request and that’s it. In case you’re not logged in to your Gmail account, you’ll have to login in the first step, and then confirm the synchronization request. From that moment going forward, whenever your manager publishes or changes any of your shifts, your work schedule will be synchronized with your Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Google-Calendar-JosephPerry.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Google-Calendar-JosephPerry-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Calendar Synced With Work Schedule App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us also mention that your schedule will not automatically sync immediately upon connecting your NimbleSchedule account with your Google Calendar. Once the connection is made, this synchronization will simply wait for the next time when your shifts are created or edited. In case you’re a manager or an admin level user, you can just re-publish your schedule in order to see it sync right away. If you’re an employee level user, you can either wait for your managers to publish your schedule next time or simply ask them to re-publish it and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Automated Conflict Checks – Employee Scheduling With No Headaches</title>
   <link href="/blog/automated-conflict-checks-employee-scheduling-with-no-headaches/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-17T04:43:29-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/automated-conflict-checks-employee-scheduling-with-no-headaches</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In companies where old fashioned ways of scheduling employees and tracking their availability and time off days is used, managers tend to spend a lot of time on these workforce management processes. Moreover, chances are high that they may miss a valuable piece of information and double book an employee for two different shifts, or schedule an employee that took a day off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for those that jumped on the train of modern progress and decided to use software to handle the scheduling process, things look slightly better. With various inputs in place, most of employee scheduling tools can create a conflict free roster and minimize shift scheduling issues. Well, at least most of software tools can handle that, not all. With NimbleSchedule, conflict checks are done with multiple pieces of information and all available info is put in place when scheduling process is handled. Here are some areas and pieces of information that automatically affect the scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;approved-time-off-requests&quot;&gt;Approved Time-Off Requests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Time-Off-Requests.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Time-Off-Requests-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Time-Off Requests&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where employers wish to have an official time-off procedure for their employees, NimbleSchedule has a feature design to handle that part. It’s completely optional and employers can choose to disable it, if it is not needed. An employer/administrator can also configure the system to accept employees’ time off requests a certain number of days in advance. Such requests go to managers for an approval, and once approved, such employee calendar becomes grayed out on the schedule to clearly signal the scheduler that an employee has taken time off. If any manager or scheduler decides to schedule an unavailable employee, a warning will show up, preventing any kind of mistaken scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weekly-repeating-unavailability&quot;&gt;Weekly (repeating) unavailability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Weekly-Availability.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Weekly-Availability-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Weekly Repeating Un-Availability&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an employer chooses, an option for employees to set their weekly repeating un-availability will show up on their profiles allowing them to configure it (or managers can do that on their behalf). Once an employee blocks out certain days or certain parts of days, such date/time slots will be grayed out on the schedule, preventing any conflicting shift to be assigned. The manager or scheduler that tries to assign an employee with a shift that partially or fully occurs during the weekly unavailability will receive a warning from the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-unavailability&quot;&gt;Future unavailability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Future-Availability.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Future-Availability-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Setting Future Un-Availability&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees can also set their future availability through NimbleSchedule, which affects certain dates only. As opposed to weekly repeating un-availability, employees can navigate through the “My Schedule” page to a certain date and block out a specific date or time during a specific day to signal the manager or scheduler that they are not available at that time. Of course, an employee can repeat such unavailability for a certain number of days or weeks, but as opposed to the weekly repeating one, this type of unavailability will eventually end. Again, an employee’s future un-availability will be grayed out on the schedule, thus preventing any kind of mistake during the scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;profile-schedule-limitations&quot;&gt;Profile schedule limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Scheduling-Limitations.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Scheduling-Limitations-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling Limitations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from various un-availabilities and time off requests that employees can set or request through the system, there are also certain limitations that can be defined for each employee’s profile by either the administrator or the manager. Currently, the system covers four different limitations that can be customized for each individual profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Maximum hours per week&lt;/strong&gt; – Allows the manager to limit an employee to a certain number of hours per week. If anyone tries to schedule that person for more, the warning will be displayed preventing any mistakes.
• &lt;strong&gt;Maximum hours per day&lt;/strong&gt; – Allows the manager to limit an employee to a certain number of hours per each day. If someone tries to schedule that employee for a certain day for more hours than allowed per profile setting, the system will display a warning.
• &lt;strong&gt;Maximum days per week&lt;/strong&gt; – Allows the manager or administrator to limit the number of work days per week for each employee. In cases when someone tries to schedule an employee for more days than allowed per profile setting, the system will display a warning.
• &lt;strong&gt;Maximum shifts per day&lt;/strong&gt; – Allows the manager to configure the maximum number of shifts per day an employee can work. Needless to say, if anyone tries to schedule an employee for more shifts than permitted per profile setting, the system will display a warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these different inputs, along with previously mentioned un-availabilities and time off requests, are taken into consideration when auto-filling open shifts and automatically assigning the schedule. Also, if the manager or scheduler manually inputs all shifts, the system will display warnings or errors if cases a specific shift puts an employee over any of these limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-double-booking-or-overlapping&quot;&gt;No double booking or overlapping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Schedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Employee-Schedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling With No Headaches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, NimbleSchedule prevents any kind of double booking and/or shift overlapping for a single employee. This means that if an employee is already scheduled for a shift and another manager/scheduler tries to book him for a date/time slot that overlaps with the existing one, the system will show a warning. The scheduler will be prevented from moving forward, while the manager will be presented with an option to automatically move the old/conflicting shift into open shifts and assign a new shift to the employee.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why is Cloud Computing a Safer Choice?</title>
   <link href="/blog/why-is-cloud-computing-a-safer-choice/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-10T05:30:24-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/why-is-cloud-computing-a-safer-choice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The cloud software industry has tremendously advanced in the last couple of years. With more and more people and companies using various cloud services, the industry is on the rise. On the other hand, as with anything new, there is a certain level of skepticism that hinders even more companies or individuals from joining the revolution. One of the frequently mentioned concerns is security, of course. Well, in this article we’ll cover a couple of reasons why cloud use is actually safer than using the traditional desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Why-is-cloud-computing-a-safer-choice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Why is Cloud Computing a Safer Choice?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hard-drive-failure&quot;&gt;Hard drive failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the traditional software stored on your local computer or server, there is always a risk of hard drive failure and data loss. Unless you’re a hardcore technology evangelist and you have a backup of all your data done on a daily basis, chances are pretty high that you use a single hard drive to store many valuable information in your office, which can often times lead to loss due to a HDD failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With cloud computing, that risk is brought to a minimum. Serious industry players have reliable servers with multiple hard drives connected in RAID, thus allowing safer data storage. On top of that, such companies (like ours for that matter) create backups on a regular basis and are ready to restore any piece of information at any point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment-failure&quot;&gt;Equipment failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from just dealing with hard drive failure risks, there’s other equipment involved in that equation. Such failures may not be as severe as the HDD failure since the data will be preserved on the hard drive, yet it may cause other issues as you may not be able to access your data for certain time until your computer or server is actually restored. If you’re running a business that requires access to certain software and data throughout the whole day, that’s downtime that you cannot afford to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Using a cloud system, the risk of the equipment failure is again completely minimized. Of course, theoretically, failures may happen in the cloud company network infrastructure as well; however, keep in mind that such downtime is usually measured in minutes with the spare equipment and experts waiting to address any malfunction almost instantly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;software-failure&quot;&gt;Software failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the latest versions of operating systems are much more stable than those from the 1990s or early 2000s, there are still risks of OS failure which could leave you without the server or computer that you need to use on a daily basis for a certain period of time. This can also lead to a bit more complicated procedures of creating a backup of data which you may need before you re-install the OS on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such risks are non-existent with cloud computing networks. Cloud companies usually have teams of experts that monitor their server performances and are ready to react pro-actively to prevent any software failure (or hardware failure for that matter).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment-theft&quot;&gt;Equipment theft&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case your company gets robbed, you may lose your data or access to data for some time. That’s a risk that many companies cannot afford. This is why it is a much better idea to have your data safely stored in a secured cloud computing data center with surveillance and access restrictions in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are just some overall reasons on why cloud computing should be a much safer choice to store your company, or personal information. When you take into consideration other reasons, like cheaper pricing, easier access and cloud apps handling, then it is an obvious choice which path is better.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Re-capping 2015</title>
   <link href="/blog/re-capping-2015/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-05T05:18:35-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/re-capping-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/re-capping-2014/&quot;&gt;“Re-capping 2014 and looking forward to 2015”&lt;/a&gt; article, you must have realized that 2014 was a great year for NimbleSchedule. Well, truth to be told, 2015 was even better! Our development team made so many improvements and adjustments to the system that it would be very hard to list them all and not to forget at least some of them. We also extended our list of partnering systems by integrating with some very reputable industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/recapping2015.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule Employee Scheduling - Recap of the year&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background, our team grew as we hired more experts and worked even harder to make everyone happy with our service and software performance. If you are mainly interested in the software features and improvements, and we have no doubts you are, then you’ll probably be glad to hear that our development team tripled in the number of full time developers actively working on the software development. That means more features, more improvements and more options!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the start of the year to the end, we have more than doubled our client base! We’re so proud of that fact. Both our sales and customer care teams grew enough to handle the existing customer base and successfully on-board and serve many new clients. With the variety of useful options and features, our platform remains one of the best cloud scheduling and time tracking apps on the market covering needs of small, medium and enterprise scale businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When it comes to partnerships, we added some really big names to the list. The one that echoed the most around the web was our integration with Epson, which was announced and [mentioned by many reputable online magazines and news media](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/the-epson-integration-internet-buzz/), such as CNNMoney, Yahoo Finance and Reuters. This amazing integration allows business owners with the POS terminal manufactured by Epson to seamlessly integrate their sales data into our system and easily monitor their income vs staffing costs. Furthermore, we added support for additional payroll providers and systems such as Paychex Online and Paychex Preview.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2015 we also separated our scheduling and time clock modules into two standalone products, allowing companies to choose one or both modules for their needs. Aside from that, we also implemented per user (per month) pricing which allows more flexibility versus the fixed package limitations that’s still widespread among some other systems. Our method allows more flexibility to business owners requiring them to pay just for the number of employees they actually need to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from many new features and adjustments we made during 2015, we also implemented an in-app messaging feature which allows clients to communicate with our customer care team easily while using the software, without having to leave the page. This feature was quite well received among clients, who can now seek support from our experienced team through many different channels, like live chat, in-app messenger, ticketing system, phone, or even social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could go on and on with enumerating all of the 2015’s achievements,  but you know what? We have a better idea. Why don’t you stick around and witness all the great changes we plan to implement in 2016? Just to give you a small hint - with triple the size of our development team, we must be preparing some really amazing changes and super useful features, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned and stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Tips to Prepare Your Business for Holidays</title>
   <link href="/blog/7-tips-to-prepare-your-business-for-holidays/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-21T05:57:16-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/7-tips-to-prepare-your-business-for-holidays</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the holiday season just around the corner, it’s time you start implementing your game plan, which, hopefully, you developed months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no, wait, you forgot to prepare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never fear! Here are some valuable tips that will help you with last minute preparations. And if you did have time to prepare your business for the upcoming holiday season, you can use our tips as a checklist to see if you’ve got everything in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tips-to-prepare-your-business-for-holidays.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7 Tips to Prepare Your Business for Holidays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;holiday-discounts&quot;&gt;Holiday discounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider offering crazy sales discounts to your existing or new clients during holidays. Also, make sure to check what your competitors are doing in order to get some ideas. Once you have those magical numbers, start promoting your holiday offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put promotional materials around the store, send out an email newsletter, and use your social media channels to broadcast the offer. People are very sensitive when it comes to self-promoting emails or social media posts, so make sure your offer is so good that they can’t resist it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also utilize passive advertising methods as well and put flyers and brochures around the store or replace your social media cover photos with the promotional images and wait for visitors and buyers to spot your great offer on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;encourage-the-holiday-spirit&quot;&gt;Encourage the holiday spirit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although your sales and customer support representatives should probably be smiling throughout the whole year, the holiday season is special. Encourage your employees to mention holidays when communicating with clients and share some of that holiday spirit with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use appropriate cheerful decorations around your store or on your website, which will place everyone into a good and special mood. Keep in mind that the holiday season may bring extra stress to some people due to their work obligations so make sure that the overall atmosphere in your store or on your website cheer them up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;follow-and-join-local-community-events&quot;&gt;Follow and join local community events&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re running a store and your local community plans on organizing some holiday events, make sure you’re a part of them. One of the best ways for your business to get some holiday promotion is to sponsor an event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from contributing financially, you can encourage your employees to take part in holiday competitions and represent your company in the best possible way. Such activities may give your business some public exposure and get you more sales during the holiday season and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-some-extra-hands-on-deck&quot;&gt;Get some extra hands on deck&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering aggressive discounted prices during the holiday season can cause an increase in the number of people walking into your store. One of the last things you’d probably want is long lines with people getting frustrated for having to wait too long to close their sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you leave your customers and visitors waiting too long for customer service, or delivery of a product purchased on your website, rest assured that you WILL leave a bad taste about your overall service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, make sure you have some extra help and some extra hands on deck during the holiday season. If you have enough employees to provide the extra coverage,you’re good to go. If not, then make sure you hire some additional workforce for the holidays that will help your business run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;boost-your-employees-productivity&quot;&gt;Boost your employees’ productivity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use all available tools and methods to boost your employees’ productivity during the holidays. Actually, use them to boost your own productivity as well, which is even more important!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many apps and gadgets you could use on your smart phone or computer, there are no excuses to fail in this area. You can use various automated tools to post reminders to your employees or managers, display organizational plans to your team leads in a shareable environment or use employee management systems to organize your workforce schedule easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certainly other creative ideas on how you could use technology to help you better organize for the holiday season. However, if you are one of those old schoolers who’s not so fond of technology, a printed out holiday schedule, pinned on a visible board, may do the trick. Make it visually appealing so everyone gets reminded once in a while about the holiday game-plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;check-your-inventory&quot;&gt;Check your inventory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During those last minute preparations, make sure that you have enough product in stock to satisfy your anticipated demand. The same goes if you run an online store. Make sure you have enough of everything during the whole holiday season but especially during the holiday day itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing would be more disappointing to your customers than seeing half empty or completely empty shelves. So make sure you are well prepared and that your employees are fully aware that part of their duties is re-stocking the store shelves throughout the day. The best way to prepare your inventory is to plan in advance, but if you are one of those last minute folks, then make sure you’ve called all your suppliers to get enough of everything for the actual holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;start-the-day-a-bit-earlier-than-usual&quot;&gt;Start the day a bit earlier than usual&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the holiday season comes, consider starting your day a bit earlier than usual. It would be great if you could get your employees to come to the store a bit earlier, but if they are not so fond of that idea, then your personal presence may suffice. Get there early, organize everyone, go one more time through your plans, and make sure you have everything ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the holiday shopping begin!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Paychex Preview Support</title>
   <link href="/blog/paychex-preview-support/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-19T04:37:03-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/paychex-preview-support</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest advantages of cloud systems is an option to integrate with other cloud systems in order to make business management a lot easier and to cover more aspects. That’s why our development team is constantly working on new integrations and options regardless of if those integrations are built with full or semi automation. Our latest addition of 3rd party systems with which our software can communicate, at least in a semi-automated manner, is Paychex Preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to allow our clients who use Paychex Preview to easily sync their payroll data, our development team has built a new file export feature. From now on, all clients using this payroll system will be able to configure the system easily and export the payroll report file in the format that’s automatically accepted by Paychex Preview and handle their payroll execution within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Paychex-Preview-Settings.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Paychex-Preview-Settings-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paychex Preview - Settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to configure this new feature in our system, please navigate to the Payroll Settings section and from there, select the “Paychex Preview” feature from the drop down. Once you do that, you’ll get a list of fields for parameters that you can obtain from Paychex. You’ll be asked to enter your company code with Paychex Preview, as well as your hourly codes for regular hours, overtime hours, double time hours and special hour code. You can also select an option to include the earned total amount for each shift in the export file. If you already have a pay-rate properly set through Paychex Preview system for all your employees, then you can just disable the amount calculation for the payroll export file since the system will automatically calculate the amount based on the pay-rate setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Export-to-Paychex-Preview.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Export-to-Paychex-Preview-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Export to Paychex Preview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the settings section covered, you will no longer have to worry about that step. All you need to do is to run your payroll report as you would in our system, and in the top right corner you’ll notice a new button with the label “Export to Paychex Preview”. Once you click on it, the system will generate a textual file with all your data. You just need to ensure one thing before you proceed with this export: all your employees need to have their employee id configured on their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Paychex-Preview-Export-File.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Paychex-Preview-Export-File-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paychex Preview Export File&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the screenshot above, you can see how that export file may look like, with a different data, of course. If everything looks alright when you export your file, you can proceed to import it into your Paychex Preview system. This allows you to easily complete your payroll processing for all your employees in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any comments or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us through our contact page. We look forward to hearing your opinion on this newly added feature!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Feature Updates and Improvements</title>
   <link href="/blog/feature-updates-and-improvements/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-13T01:00:29-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/feature-updates-and-improvements</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce a minor release of our 6.22 version focusing on a couple of feature updates and improvements. Sometimes our team releases code improvements which are more of the under-the-hood type of updates ; however, with this patch release, we added a couple of adjustments which may be very useful and worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;excluding-a-user-from-the-schedules-section&quot;&gt;Excluding a user from the schedules section&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/exclude-from-schedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/exclude-from-schedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exclude from schedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve included a new option to employees’ profiles, which allows you to exclude a specific person from the schedules section. Often times companies have a group of managers or schedulers that need to be in the system in order to manage employees, but they do not necessarily wish to have such employees shown up in the scheduling component. With the latest feature adjustment, any user can be hidden from the scheduling component once the “Exclude from schedules” option is enabled. By minimizing distractions of hiding unnecessary profiles from the schedules component, the whole rostering process becomes easy and hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adjustments-of-the-scheduler-role&quot;&gt;Adjustments of the Scheduler role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the adjustments that came along with the latest update covered the Scheduler role permissions. On the screenshot above, you can see different kinds of scheduling limitations that can be set for each user in our online schedule maker. Nonetheless, these limitations represent soft limits, so a scheduler, manager and/or admin can choose to ignore any of those limits and proceed with scheduling a user even after seeing a warning thus pushing such an employee over his set schedule limitations. With the latest adjustment, that option has been taken away from any user with the Scheduler role. The Scheduler can no longer override such a limit so once an employee hits the limit set on his/her profile, the scheduler will have no option to ignore a warning and schedule an employee for a shift. After getting a warning, the scheduler will either have to assign a shift to another employee or simply resolve such a scheduling conflict by cooperating with the manager or administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-manager-role-adjustment&quot;&gt;The Manager role adjustment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager role has also been adjusted regarding employee management within the system. Up till now, managers had the full access to manage employees’ profiles, including adding or deleting any employee. This part has now been slightly changed so from now on, although managers will still be able to add users to the system or update their existing profiles, they will not be able to delete employee profiles from the system anymore. The only thing they’ll be able to do is to terminate or unterminate an employee’s profile.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Preventing No-Shows and Late Arrivals with NimbleSchedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/preventing-no-shows-and-late-arrivals-with-nimbleschedule/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-05T04:35:55-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/preventing-no-shows-and-late-arrivals-with-nimbleschedule</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing employee schedules can sometimes be a tedious and time consuming task especially when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/&quot;&gt;schedule makers&lt;/a&gt; need to manage larger groups of staff members. However, with the advancement of cloud employee scheduling software, some of those issues and concerns have been properly addressed. Besides assisting managers and employers in their daily operations, cloud technology can help employees as well when it comes to absenteeism reduction and cutting down on late arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll cover some of NimbleSchedule’s features and tools available to both managers and employees, which help them easily monitor late arrivals as well as prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Shift-Reminders-And-Late-Notifications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Shift-Reminders-And-Late-Notifications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Reminders and Late Notifications&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shift-reminders&quot;&gt;Shift Reminders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, each account comes with a specific set of notifications that can be enabled for each user in the system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;“Upcoming Shift Reminder – 24 hours”&lt;/em&gt; – By enabling this notification on their profiles, employees can choose to be notified via email or SMS about their upcoming shifts, 24 hours ahead of that specific shift.
• &lt;em&gt;“Upcoming Shift Reminder – 60/90/120 minutes”&lt;/em&gt; – With this notification, employees can receive an email or an SMS reminder about their upcoming shift. This notification can be set for either 60, 90 or 120 minutes before their shift starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers and managers can choose to enable these notifications on behalf of their employees to ensure that they are properly notified about created shifts when a schedule is published. Naturally, employees can set any of these two notifications through their personal profiles in the system. These reminders significantly reduce no shows and late arrivals and they save companies significant funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-employees-are-late&quot;&gt;When employees are late&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, sometimes not even notifications can help as some employees tend to come late to their shifts or do not show up at work at all for one reason or the other. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the manager is notified on time so that he could re-schedule some of the available staff members to cover an uncovered position or simply to give a call to the person being late to check up on whether they’re coming to work at all or just running a little bit late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For such cases, managers have an additional option which they can enable for their personal profiles. The exact notification label/name is &lt;em&gt;“When my employees are late”&lt;/em&gt; and managers and administrators can find it under their personal “Notification Preferences” section on their profile. By enabling this option along with either email or SMS, managers can be notified through one of those two methods in case their employee is running late for their shift for at least 5 minutes. This early warning system allows managers to re-act promptly and cover necessary positions in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Clearing Unwanted Shifts</title>
   <link href="/blog/clearing-unwanted-shifts/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-29T05:49:48-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/clearing-unwanted-shifts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Creating shifts and schedules with NimbleSchedule is easy and hassle-free. No matter if you decide to use the “Copy To Next Week” option, the templates system or to repeat a single shift by using various patterns, the goal is the same - to somehow automate the schedule creation which repeats on any reasonable pattern. However, clearing a schedule, which you perhaps created by mistake, or you simply need to re-create it for any other reason, may sometimes cause a headache. Here are some simple ways you can use to easily remove an unwanted schedule or shift, either for everyone at a single location or for a specific person with multiple shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-clear-schedule-option-in-the-tools-menu&quot;&gt;The “Clear Schedule” option in the Tools menu&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clear-Schedule-Tools.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clear-Schedule-Tools-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The &#39;Clear Schedule&#39; option in the Tools menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using this option, you can easily clear the whole schedule, no matter if it consists of published or unpublished shifts for all your employees at a single location. Depending on the schedule view you’re using (daily, weekly or monthly), this option will erase the schedule for either just one day, one full week or for the whole month. Hence, this option is to be used with some caution when using wider date ranges in order to make sure not to erase the group of shifts that you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-clear-schedule-option-next-to-your-employees-name&quot;&gt;The “Clear Schedule” option next to your employee’s name&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clear-Schedule-Employee.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clear-Schedule-Employee-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The &#39;Clear Schedule&#39; option next to your employee’s name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases when you do not want to erase the schedule for all employees at your location, you can use the “Clear Schedule” option which shows up next to your employee’s name in order to cover just that specific employee. By using this feature, the system will erase the full schedule for your given employee starting from the current date and going forward. This means that if you are working in the weekly view of the schedule, this option will not just erase the schedule for a given employee for the week you are reviewing, but for any date range starting from the actual current date and going forward. This feature will skip any past shifts, meaning that the work history will be kept for your respected employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deleting-a-single-shift&quot;&gt;Deleting a single shift&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clear-Schedule-SingleDelete.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clear-Schedule-SingleDelete-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Deleting a single shift&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most basic activities, you can use the “Delete” option, which shows up on the shift dialog once you click on a specific shift. Instead of mentioning it first, we left this approach for the end. While it may be great for removing just a couple of shifts, this option may be somewhat complex when handling removal of a large number of shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to View Real Time Sales Data Along With Staffing Costs</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-view-real-time-sales-data-along-with-staffing-costs/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-22T04:14:59-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-view-real-time-sales-data-along-with-staffing-costs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our previous articles we have covered many different ways which allow one to easily monitor staffing costs even during the scheduling process. What is even better, our staff scheduling software features reports that enable the comparison between the scheduled cost and the actual cost according to the time clock entries. This allows company admins to easily stay on track and monitor employee staffing costs throughout multiple reports and data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to provide an even better overview of the live company money expenses, our engineers designed a chart on our dashboard which allows an insight into scheduled costs across various locations. Initially, the missing link on that chart was the ability of displaying the sales information and providing company admins and managers with an easy to use comparison chart between the actual live sales data and staffing costs. With that idea in mind, and with the data served by our partners, widely known POS systems, our users can now easily stay on top of such information by integrating with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chart-7Days.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Staffing Costs vs Sales - 7 Days&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the screenshot above, in cases when there’s an integration with one of our POS partners, the sales data feed will show up on the chart on the dashboard. The blue line represents your actual sales, while the red line represents your staffing costs. Aside from the weekly chart shown above, the system also featured the daily view, which will allow you an hourly gradation and comparison between your scheduled costs and actual sales data coming from your POS system of choice. Furthermore, to gain even a larger scale overview, our system features the monthly chart view which will show you the comparison of your live sale data vs scheduled costs for the last 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chart-30Days.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Staffing Costs vs Sales - 30 Days&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With such information at fingertips, company schedulers and managers can now make their schedule decisions easily and re-arrange schedules according to the actual live income data. This allows much easier company management with significant gains in effectiveness and costs control.  Companies do not have to waste their money on scheduling extra employees for days, or hours during certain days that do not bring enough income which would justify such expenses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By all means, there is nothing revolutionary about this small adjustment to the system that was made by our engineers and developers. However, a bundle of such small tricks and tools along the way is what makes our online staff scheduling system stand out from our competitors and allows easier and better employee schedule management. Our team continues to deliver new tools and gadgets that will ensure even better management of staffing needs, while helping you save some extra money. Stay tuned for more Nimble updates!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>6 Simple Things That Will Boost Your Productivity</title>
   <link href="/blog/6-simple-things-that-will-boost-your-productivity/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-21T05:15:26-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/6-simple-things-that-will-boost-your-productivity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re a busy person, then one of your main challenges is probably how to get more time to finish certain tasks and projects or, alternatively, how to boost your productivity in order to get more stuff done in less time. That’s why we’ve prepared a list of some fairly simple things that you can start implementing straightaway, which will eventually lead to increased productivity at your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/things-that-will-boost-productivity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simple Things That Will Boost Your Productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;merge-similar-tasks-into-a-single-batch&quot;&gt;1. Merge similar tasks into a single batch&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to complete a group of similar tasks during the day, like making a set of calls, writing emails or anything similar, it may be a great idea to bundle all the tasks into a single batch and complete them all at once. Instead of procrastinating, you should try to finish them one by one in a row, while your mind is set to a working mode and get everything done as soon as possible so that you could re-focus your attention to something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;divide-large-tasks-into-smaller-chunks&quot;&gt;2. Divide large tasks into smaller chunks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you probably hesitate to start working on some very large or difficult task because you know in advance that it will take you a ton of time and you may not even finish it in a day. A good idea would be to divide such tasks into smaller chunks and focus on getting such chunks out of your daily to-do list. If needed, you can delegate certain parts to your employees or colleagues thus saving your time for other, more important, aspects of your daily duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resolve-small-tasks-right-away&quot;&gt;3. Resolve small tasks right away&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is also known as the “2-minute rule”. If it would take you less than 2 minutes to complete a certain task, complete it immediately and do not leave it for later. Force yourself to take action straightaway because the sheer effort of memorizing or writing down a task may sometimes take you much more time than completing it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-how-you-spend-your-time&quot;&gt;4. Track how you spend your time&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have a feeling that time just flies by when you sit down to work and you do not even remember why it took you so long to finish something you thought it would take much less time. If this happens more often than you would like, it may be a great idea for you to start using some smart phone apps or computer software that will help you keep tracking your time. That way you can refer to your log and see what went wrong and why it took you so much time to complete a certain task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stay-away-from-distractions&quot;&gt;5. Stay away from distractions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people say that music being played softly in the background makes their work day better and keeps them better engaged rather than working in silence. There are, however, those who claim that such a working atmosphere leads to a significant waste of time and concentration especially when a set of their “favorite” songs starts playing and they start singing along. The same can be said for some other distractions like chit chatting with colleagues throughout the whole day, surfing the web or using social media websites. Therefore, if you notice any of these things start taking too much of your time or you become distracted, simply shut them off while working and allow yourself some of those “treats” during your breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;learn-to-say-no&quot;&gt;6. Learn to say “no”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your colleagues might come to you and ask for a favor which would include disrupting  your schedule and moving your focus from completing important business tasks to some trivial things. In such cases, the best idea would be to politely say “No” and keep your focus and energy on things and tasks that you need to complete during your working hours.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reliable and Accurate Payroll Reporting</title>
   <link href="/blog/reliable-and-accurate-payroll-reporting/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-14T06:11:24-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/reliable-and-accurate-payroll-reporting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The challenge of managing employee payroll reports can sometimes be overwhelming no matter if you have one or thirty-one employee. After all, payroll management is an important aspect of any business. The good thing is that there are certain things you can do to make the whole process of payroll reporting much easier and less stressful. Here’s how NimbleSchedule can take care of your payroll management needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the shift is over and your employees have clocked out, it’s time for approval. You, as the manager can simply navigate to the Timesheets page and review your employees’ time punches. In order to approve them, you can use the “Approve All” button above the list, or approve one by one record by clicking on the gray checkmark next to each entry. When the check-mark turns into green, that means that such an entry has been approved, so you can move on. As soon as you have all your employees’ time clock records approved, you can run the payroll report based on that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timesheet-approval.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timesheet-approval-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timesheets Approval Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to run the payroll report, you can just click on the “Payroll report” link in the Time Clock section, or navigate to the Reports tab and click on the “Payroll” link in the sub-menu there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/generate-payroll.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/generate-payroll-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Payroll Reporting System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the payroll report page, you’ll notice you have some options to select from. You can choose to cover just one out of your multiple locations or all locations at once. Moving to the right, you’ll have a chance to select all employees, or just some of them whom you want to include in the report. Next to that column, you’ll have an option to select some additional fields to include in the report, like the location name next to each entry, position names, pay rates for each entry, etc. These are just some additional fields, so you can skip them and the system will show the default pre-selected fields, so you do not have to worry about these. In the last column on the right, you can select overtime calculations, in case you need that, and whether or not you wish the system to exclude unpaid breaks from the totals on the payroll report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have all desired options selected, you can click on the “Generate” button in the top right corner and choose to see either a Detailed payroll report or a Summary. The names are pretty much self-explanatory but let us point out that with the Summary report, you’ll see one employee per row with the totals shown on the right. With the detailed payroll report, you’ll see an each time clock entry displayed in a separate line for each of your employees, with totals for each employee.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is Customer Service the New Marketing?</title>
   <link href="/blog/is-customer-service-the-new-marketing/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-13T03:50:26-08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the sea of different products and services advertised across various media channels, the process of selecting the right product or service has become a bit more challenging for an average consumer. Some companies spend huge amounts of money on their marketing plans and their high advertising budgets quite often manage to push through a product or service to the consumer market even if they’re not so great. With that in mind, the thought process of an average consumer is slightly shifting toward evaluating other aspects of companies. In other words, consumers are not relying solely on what they hear in commercials any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/customer-service.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customer Service&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recently conducted survey, an amazing 90% of the surveyed people claimed that a positive review read online about a specific business had a positive impact on them, helping them make a decision of becoming a client of a specific company. More than 86% of respondents stated that negative reviews had pushed them away from becoming a client or a consumer of a specific product/company.  About the same percentage of people (86%) stated that they had quit doing business with certain companies because they had had a bad customer support experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to gain a new client, a company has to spend at least 5-6 times more than to keep an existing client happy with them. In order to achieve such a goal, customer support has to be outstanding. However, only 10% of the surveyed stated they had received satisfactory customer service. Generally speaking, clients don&#39;t like to complain. They stay silent even when something doesn’t work as expected. What they do is they share their opinions with friends, colleagues or even online review communities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, companies should value the feedback they get from clients. Moreover, companies should encourage clients to provide candid feedback and complaints, because that’s the best way for them to  learn that something doesn’t work well for their clients. In order to make that process possible, customer support needs to rise to the occasion. Customer support reps must be properly trained and confident in the knowledge they have. Almost 75% of those who cancelled doing business with certain companies stated that the main reason for that was incompetent customer support. Almost half of those who did reach out to customer support to complain stated that they would do it only once and just quit if their questions or issues were not properly addressed. This means that customer support reps have to be available throughout various means of communications (live chats, phone support, tickets, email, etc) and to demonstrate their high knowledge of the product or the system they support. At all times. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, apart from being an extremely important aspect of the company’s business, customer support is a leading “tool” a company can use to improve customer experience, spread the good word and influence the average consumer. A great deal of prospects around the web, who approach their shopping process only after reviewing companies reputation on various forums, board and discussion groups, evaluates customer support comments with great attention. This makes the customer support team the ambassador of every company. So, choose your CS team members carefully, train them thoroughly and respect them deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New in Patch 6.22.5</title>
   <link href="/blog/new-in-patch-6-22-5/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-08T05:01:28-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/new-in-patch-6-22-5</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From time to time, our development team releases patches with improvements and fixes that you may not even notice while using the system. The latest patch, officially called 6.22.5, brought a very interesting new feature and a couple of improvements and adjustments to the existing functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly added feature is called “Shift changes”. As an existing user, you can utilize it by enabling the option “Employees can request shift change” in the Schedule area of the Settings section. Once you do that, your employees will be able to submit a couple of new types of requests. To be more precise, your employees will have a chance to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Shift-Change.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Shift-Change-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to enable Shift Changes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Add New Shift&lt;/strong&gt; – This option allows your employees to submit a desired time slot and the position they would like to work. Once submitted, that request comes to the manager or administrator for an approval. When they approve it, the system automatically creates a shift for an employee with the submitted data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Change Shift&lt;/strong&gt; – This option allows your employees to submit a desired change to an existing shift. A request with the adjusted time slot goes to the manager or administrator for an approval, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Reassign Shift&lt;/strong&gt; – This option allows your employee to ask for an approval for their existing shift to be reassigned to another employee. An employee will also have a chance to select a co-worker with the same position/ job role and, once the manager approves such a request, the shift will be re-assigned to the suggested employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Remove Shift&lt;/strong&gt; – This option allows your employee to request a removal of their shift. As opposed to our standard “Drop shift” request, the shift will be completely removed instead of being sent to the Open Shifts area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As with all other scheduling features in our system, both employees and managers will be notified with appropriate notifications for all these requests, either via email or SMS.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the above-mentioned new feature, a couple of adjustments and improvements were made to the existing set of features. One of those adjustments to the existing features is the option to allow managers to adjust pay rates for employees working on locations they manage. Per requests that came from a lot of clients who wanted to have more control over who could change the pay rate for an employee, we made an adjustment to the system which no longer allows such data to be changed by anyone working in the manager user role. In order to adjust the pay rate for any employee, from now on the system will require an adjustment to be made by someone working in the “Admin” user role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, a few significant improvements were made to the code that handles shift changes so large companies with a lot of shifts per each location may notice significant speed improvement on their end. Those who manage less than a couple of hundreds of employees per a single location and less than a couple of thousands of shifts per location may not notice any difference, as the system will work quite fast in their case. However, those with hundreds of employees and thousands of shifts per a single location will notice significant improvement while editing shifts, re-assigning them to other employees and similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In case you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us and send us your feedback via our [contact page](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>6 Things You Must Try Out If You Are a NimbleScheduler</title>
   <link href="/blog/things-you-must-try/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-05T04:03:42-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/things-you-must-try</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you’ve decided to give NimbleSchedule a try. Whether you’re a trial or a paying customer, learning features, tips, and tricks will help you get the most out NimbleSchedule. That’s why we’ve prepared a list of 6 cool features that will help you manage your workforce and expedite the process of employee scheduling. Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;schedule-templates&quot;&gt;1) Schedule templates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-schedule-templates.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-schedule-templates-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule templates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scheduling your employees for a similar or exactly the same schedule from week to week or month to month, you can utilize many features that our system offers in order to speed up that process. One of those great features is the Template functionality which allows you to save a schedule for a week, month, or just a couple of days and re-apply that very template to any other date range. In cases when there’s a need to setup a rotating schedule, the template system is a real life saver since it allows you to apply multiple templates at the same time, and/or rotate them across various weeks. After you apply a template, your schedule will remain in the draft mode so you can always use the template as a starting point and then make certain adjustments before you publish the schedule and notify your staff members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;announcements-and-direct-messages&quot;&gt;2) Announcements and direct messages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2-announcements-and-messages.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2-announcements-and-messages-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Announcements and direct messages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our announcement and direct/private messaging system, you can easily notify certain groups of employees separated in a couple of different ways. With direct messages you can send a message to all employees working in a certain position or a certain department in your company. On the other hand, with announcements you can post a message to all your employees working at a certain location. With both you can, of course, send a message to all your employees thus saving a lot of time when the time comes to communicate certain company-wide notifications or announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;job-codes&quot;&gt;3) Job Codes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-job-codes.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-job-codes-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Job Codes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the optional things you can use with NimbleSchedule’s Time Clock is the Job Code functionality. Once you enable it in the settings section, you’ll be able to setup various job codes you need and have your employees clock out with a specific job code assigned. What that means is that you can easily monitor the time spent by your employees on certain job codes, being tasks, projects, clients, or any other relevant piece of info that you need to track. With a couple of different reports that allow you to filter out the data per job code basis, including the payroll report, you can easily stay on top of any kind of tasks or project costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;text-message-notifications&quot;&gt;4) Text message notifications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-text-message-notifications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-text-message-notifications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Text message notifications&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our online scheduler, you can customize what kind of notifications you wish your employees to receive from the system. In order to make sure that your employees are properly notified about any sort of last minute shift assignments or shift changes, then besides email notifications, you can also enable SMS notifications. With the power of text messaging, sometimes even combined with email notifications as well, you can rest assured that your employees will be properly notified and/or reminded about their shifts. No more excuses for missed shifts or late arrivals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scheduling-filters&quot;&gt;5) Scheduling filters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-scheduling-filters.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5-scheduling-filters-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scheduling filters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With two types of filters showing up above the schedule, you can easily filter out just certain groups of employees for easier supervision. As an example, you can filter out just scheduled employees in the system, or just those who are not scheduled for a particular week or day. You can also filter out just employees available to work in a certain position or certain department. By using the power of these useful filters, you can easily stay on top of all your shift coverage needs and have the full control over who works when, and what kind of shifts and day periods perhaps need a slightly better coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;power-edit&quot;&gt;6) Power Edit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6-power-edit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6-power-edit-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Power Edit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Employees section above the list of your employees, you’ll notice you have access to certain tools that allow you to have basic and a bit advanced employee management. One of those options that takes things to a new level is certainly the Power Edit option. By using our Power Edit, you can simply mass change certain employee records for any number of your employees that you have previously selected. With this mass edit functionality, you can change certain data on your employee profiles in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Attributes of a Good Employee</title>
   <link href="/blog/seven-attributes-of-a-good-employee/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-01T05:00:42-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/seven-attributes-of-a-good-employee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Great companies need great people so you, as an employer, need to recognize them. Regardless of industry, sex or age, good employees actually do share some common traits. Here are seven attributes of remarkable employees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reliability&quot;&gt;1. Reliability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good employee is always reliable and someone you can count on no matter if he needs to jump in and cover for someone else who’s sick for that day, or he needs to train a new co-worker that just started with the training process. A reliable employee comes to work on time, completes his tasks or projects on time and makes the whole team look good in front of a client, or upper management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;confidence&quot;&gt;2. Confidence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You surely do not want to have a team of arrogant folks who mistake confidence for arrogance; however, you definitely need self-assured team members that know what they are doing. Employees who are confident can identify risks and cope with them. When dealing with clients or investors who, from any reason end up communicating with your team members, you’ll want them to be and sound confident. It’s the only way to handle company operations with success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Employee-of-the-Month.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Remarkable Employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;autonomy&quot;&gt;3. Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes a significant difference between good employees and the ones less good is their autonomy to perform their daily duties and assignments. Having work autonomy and being able to handle most of the work related duties on their own is what clearly separates good employees. This characteristic is closely related to lack of self-confidence as insecure employees tend to seek help or advice from their senior colleagues more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;passion-for-work&quot;&gt;4. Passion for work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good employees are always passionate about their work. It’s one of the main reasons why they are happy to come to work every day and why they pay so much attention to certain details, while others just want to get things done and go home. If your job consists of the same duties over and over and day after day, you may notice that you are gradually losing the passion for your job. It is up to you to re-find it by either finding different ways of doing your daily tasks or simply by seeking other assignments that would keep your mind and body passionate about going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creative-thinking&quot;&gt;5. Creative thinking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of job, creativity may mean different things in different industries or job roles. However, creative employees will often times be the leading force that tries out new technologies, finds better ways of doing certain things or simply inspires everyone else around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;positive-vibes&quot;&gt;6. Positive vibes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain your company’s work culture and keep the positive spirit, your team members need to have a positive attitude when it comes to work, internal worker relations and anything else going on in the office. In order to maintain a decent level of satisfaction among your employees and keep the productive working atmosphere, you definitely need those beacons of positive thought and emotion present around the office at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ambition-and-willingness-to-learn&quot;&gt;7. Ambition and willingness to learn&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambitious employees will do their best at everything they do. Such employees are usually willing to learn, adjust and excel at things they do. They want themselves to succeed and they want your company to succeed. Ambitious employees are often times great leaders and may end up being promoted faster than the others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Halloween at Work - Dos and Don'ts</title>
   <link href="/blog/halloween-at-work-dos-and-donts/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-31T01:20:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/halloween-at-work-dos-and-donts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apart from being one of the most popular holidays of the year, Halloween also represents a great opportunity for your employees to have some fun at their workplace. Moreover, celebrating Halloween in the office is a great occasion to improve the team spirit and encourage a positive morale among your staff members. However, there are certain challenges and pitfalls that should be avoided. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/celebrating-halloween.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/celebrating-halloween-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Celebrating Halloween at Work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;costumes-or-no-costumes&quot;&gt;Costumes or no costumes?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an employee that recently started working for a company and this is your first Halloween in your current work role, then make sure to check with your colleagues about the history and tradition of wearing costumes at work. If it’s not the company tradition or your colleagues simply do not feel like wearing a costume, then you probably don’t want to be the only person in the office dressed up as a witch or a goblin when everyone else is wearing a button-up shirt or a tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if wearing costumes in the office has been a tradition in your company, make sure you wear an appropriate costume that wouldn’t make anyone else feel embarrassed, offended or discriminated. Avoid sexually oriented costumes, of any kind. Although it’s a holiday, your co-workers should not be able to see parts of your body that they wouldn’t normally see. Keep it G-rated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wearing a costume that offends anyone’s national, racial or religious rights is a big No-No. Not only could you be perceived as a person with a bad or inappropriate taste but you could also get your employers in an inappropriate situation in case someone files a complaint.  Stay away from costume themes that make fun of people with mental illnesses or have anything to do with race, religion and nationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not make fun of those who decide not to wear a costume. If someone chose not to wear it, then it’s obvious that they didn’t want that from some reason. Perhaps they just don’t feel comfortable in costumes. Whatever the reason may be, avoid making fun of such colleagues unless you want to ruin your team relations and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alcohol-or-no-alcohol&quot;&gt;Alcohol or no alcohol?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, companies allow alcohol consumption during certain holidays, Halloween being one of them. If that’s the case in your company, then take some precautionary measures  to avoid any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an employee, take it easy with alcohol. You don’t need to make a fool of yourself by falling around the office or puking in the office toilet for the whole evening thus ruining your reputation or opportunity for promotion in the future. The presence of alcohol may also lead to some inappropriate comments that could be perceived by your colleagues as a sexual harassment or some other type of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an employer, make sure to restrict the consumption of alcohol to a moderate use during your office Halloween party. If your employee gets drunk and falls down the stairs, you may get into some trouble. Keep in mind that your employees may need to drive to their homes after the office party, so too much alcohol may lead to some serious consequences. A friendly reminder to everyone about moderate alcohol consumption during the party or simply serving drinks with less alcohol may go long in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety-comes-first&quot;&gt;Safety comes first&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are throwing a Halloween pumpkin carving event, then make sure that safety is being taken seriously. With all the knives and sharp objects, you definitely shouldn’t mix such an event with alcohol, especially if your employees plan to bring kids to the party. There are certain things that simply do not mix. So, in case of a pumpkin carving event, make sure that kids always have an adult supervision, and that alcohol is definitely not being consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your office Halloween party can be a wonderful event if some pre-cautions are done. Do not let it turn into a nightmare in any way. It’s a wonderful reason to celebrate and be slightly extravagant. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How NimbleSchedule Makes Your Day Better</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-nimbleschedule-makes-your-day-better/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-29T06:29:34-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-nimbleschedule-makes-your-day-better</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If your company employs between 3 and 3003 staff members, the chances are pretty high that the scheduling process and work time tracking for employees can get quite hectic. And that’s how it has to be, right? Well, not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/how-nimblescheudle-makes-your-day-better.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/how-nimblescheudle-makes-your-day-better-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How NimbleSchedule Makes Your Day Better&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rapid &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/cloud-technology-revolution/&quot;&gt;advancement of new technologies&lt;/a&gt;, there’s certainly no reason why your company should fall behind in any way. Working people are nowadays surrounded by computers, smart phones, gadgets and all sorts of devices that could be used to automate significant part of your company’s operations, at least the ones you’ve had to manage manually until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Are you an administrator or manager who needs to manage multiple locations?&lt;/strong&gt;
You are up for such a great treat with our system! With NimbleSchedule you can easily manage multiple locations and keep your different team schedules separate. If needed, you can assign specific employees to work on multiple locations quite easily, as well. At all times, you’ll be fully aware what kinds of shifts you have, for which positions and on which locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Are you a manager with staff members across multiple time zones?&lt;/strong&gt;
Nothing to worry about, we’ve got your back. With our cloud scheduling platform, each employee can configure his own time-zone on his personal profile and have all shift times automatically converted to the local time. You as the manager, on the other hand, can use your local time to schedule everyone, approve different requests and the system will adjust all time references to your personal time-zone selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Are you a supervisor that gets a ton of phone calls, notes or emails about shift trades and replacements?&lt;/strong&gt;
Our SaaS platform can handle most of those employee requests semi-automatically, asking you for the final approval once your employees already figured what exactly they want to do with their shift, whom to trade with, or whom to ask for a replacement. Once your employee tries to trade a shift, or ask a colleague to replace them on the shift, and the other employee accepts the offer, you’ll receive a notification, which you can approve or reject. The system will save you a lot of time, while at the same time, you’ll be in control of all the things going on in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Are you an employee who’s tired of having to call 20 colleagues to find a replacement for a shift you cannot work?&lt;/strong&gt;
NimbleSchedule allows you to submit various shift requests, such as submitting a drop shift request to your manager, submitting a shift replacement request to all available colleagues in a single click, or submitting a shift trade request by simply selecting a shift you wish to trade for. In case you need to take some time off, you can use our automated system to submit such a request, as well. Has it ever happened to you that your manager approved your request and then totally forgot about it, and you got into a trouble because of that? Well, say good-bye to such cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We could continue naming all sorts of benefits that come along when a company decides to use our employee scheduling platform, but that would take a lot of time and space. For now, we’ll keep it brief and we&#39;ll keep informing you about other interesting things regarding our system in the following articles. So, stay tuned, NimbleSchedulers!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>4 Ways to Keep Your Office Millennials Engaged</title>
   <link href="/blog/4-ways-to-keep-your-office-millennials-engaged/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-25T04:12:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/4-ways-to-keep-your-office-millennials-engaged</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Millennials, the largest generation in the US population (representing one-third of the total U.S. population in 2013), are soon to become an important engine of the economy in the decades to come. Therefore, each company owner or manager striving to keep his business successful will have to learn to adapt to a new reality shaped by this demographic group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rigid enforcement of traditional rules and regulations that used to represent the building blocks in all successful businesses has become outdated and company leaders have been advised to rethink their expectations and demands when it meeting their workforce’s unique working style. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/millennials-engaged.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Keep Your Office Millennials Engaged&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you staff is made up of millennials, here are a couple of tips that will engage them better and retain their talent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep up with the latest technological trends.&lt;/strong&gt; Millennials spend a significant part of their day working and playing with their iPhones, Android phones and various computer gadgets on their laptops. If you want them to work with software made ten or more years ago, your company’s work culture will become a laughing stock among your office millennials. Hence, it’s an imperative to use all the latest technology tools and gadgets that will keep your millennials happy and well engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchy no longer means what it used to mean.&lt;/strong&gt; Deal with it! Millennials will simply not tolerate a rigid boss that yells at them or tries to set himself as being “above” anyone else in any way. Modern generations want to feel that their contribution is valued and appreciated. Try to create a flexible working environment where your employees will feel respected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let their voice be heard.&lt;/strong&gt; Modern generations value those companies where their opinions are heard and respected. Can employees in your company working on junior positions contribute when it comes to important projects or clients? Are they free to point out some problems that need to be addressed? If the answer is yes to all these questions, then your company is probably quite a cozy place for millennials to work and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive work conditions and compensations.&lt;/strong&gt; Millennials quite frequently review what previous or current employees have to say about a company before they actually look for a job position there. There are various online portals used for such a knowledge exchange where employees evaluate different companies regarding the work conditions and compensations, as well as many other aspects. Do your best to ace in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Preparing For an Online Video Interview</title>
   <link href="/blog/preparing-for-an-online-video-interview/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-24T06:25:17-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/preparing-for-an-online-video-interview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Video interviews are becoming more and more popular among job interviewers. With the advancement of technology a lot of people are nowadays being interviewed  online with a camera switched on. The video component adds some complexity that was not present with phone or voice-only online interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/video-interview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Online Video Job Interview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to &lt;em&gt;master your video interviewing techniques&lt;/em&gt;, here are some tips and tricks that may help you ace your next online job conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dress appropriately.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though you are at home and in your everyday environment, that’s certainly not the reason to treat an online video interview differently. Unless you are applying for a position of a fashion designer, your potential employer will not be interested in your clothing taste, but remember: a professional look with a buttoned up shirt can set the professional first impression with the interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cognizant of the background.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone may find that a bit silly, but a messy office or room can suggest to the employer that you are not a well-organized person since you work in such an untidy environment. Again, this is not the reason why someone may or may not hire you, but remember that you have just one chance to make the first impression. Clean up your room or office and make sure that everything that your web camera catches as the background looks well organized and as professional as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the goldilocks position for your web camera.&lt;/strong&gt; You probably don’t want your camera to be too far away from your face, but you certainly don’t want it to be too close either. Find the best angle and position where you can place your camera. Test it out a couple of times prior to the meeting and determine the best way to position the webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to all light sources.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep in mind that by appearing in a dark environment with not enough light may be perceived in a negative way by your interviewer. Make sure that the room from which you intend to do your interview has enough light, and if needed, point an extra desk lamp in your direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test the video conference platform before the meeting.&lt;/strong&gt; In case you are already invited, then you should be aware of the exact platform where that meeting will be held. Quite frequently that’s either Skype or Google Hangout, but sometimes it may be some different software, like Join.me  or RingCentral. Make sure that you test it properly prior to your actual meeting just to make sure that from the technical standpoint everything works fine. This includes the video component, your headphones, microphone and/or speakers. If your friends tell you that your voice sounds a bit muffled during the call via Skype, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t consider a slightly better internet connection speed or even a different headphones set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shine in the interview!&lt;/strong&gt; Practice a couple of times for that meeting and make sure you have all the questions and answers ready. While practicing you may even record yourself and analyze that recording afterwards in order to improve. Make sure you don’t make any facial gestures while answering certain questions, since the camera is always on you during the job interview. Try to sound positive and optimistic in order to increase your chances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are just some of the tips that you may find useful for your next online video job interview. The list certainly doesn’t end here and there are many more things you can do to prepare better for such a meeting. Stay tuned for more handy tips in our following articles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Uber Revolution: Cloud-Based Technology Takes Things to the New Level</title>
   <link href="/blog/cloud-technology-revolution/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-23T07:02:08-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/cloud-technology-revolution</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No one can deny the fact that technology has revolutionized the way companies conduct their business. At least, most of them. The advancement of technology aligned with numerous innovations changed many things in the business world, especially for those companies that use the Internet and different online services in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/uber-revolution-cloud-technology.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Primary Administrator Change&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the cloud technology takes that revolution to the whole new level. Slowly, but certainly, the era of robust desktop systems used in accounting, for employee scheduling, payroll, time tracking or any other aspect of business management is fading away. A lot of companies already transitioned to the cloud-based software solutions which offer many &lt;em&gt;advantages&lt;/em&gt; over desktop tools. Industry giants like Intuit are converting their desktop platforms to online cloud systems, offering unlimited access, from different platforms, to unlimited number of company owners, managers or associates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exponential growth of technology and all the gadgets and tools offered can sometimes be overwhelming as well. The trick is to figure out which tools may be the best fit for your industry and how to best utilize them in order to grow and improve your business. In order to harness the benefits, one must invest some time into searching the best possible solution and pair it with the existing company procedures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud apps like NimbleSchedule, BambooHR, Lightspeed, Zenpayroll, TRAX Payroll and many others offer a variety of services that can help you conduct your business in a &lt;strong&gt;more efficient&lt;/strong&gt; manner, gain an edge over competitors, increase productivity and reduce costs. Apart from the fact that SaaS systems are, for most of the time, in a perfect synchronization, which allows companies to utilize different aspects of multiple systems, the time and level of knowledge needed to maintain such systems is brought to a minimum. One might even say that the cloud technology is light years ahead of traditional desktop software systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the outdated businesses can no longer hide from this revolution. It is apparent, at this point, that in order to achieve maximum productivity and efficiency, we just simply have to utilize the technology at its best in order to move forward. Therefore, step aside, everyone - &lt;em&gt;it’s cloud technology that is now leading the way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling on Steroids: Ways to Boost Productivity and Staff Engagement</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-on-steroids/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-18T07:01:44-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-on-steroids</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the rapid advancement of technology, especially in the area of smart phones, most of traditional work place tools have been replaced with smart phone gadgets, cloud software or semi-automated apps that do the job for us. The companies that found a way to utilize all those gadgets and apps to their own advantage to improve any part of their business process are winning this race. One of those areas where businesses of all sizes benefit greatly from the technology revolution is employee scheduling. The revolution result: a myriad of cloud scheduling apps with a variety of gimmicks and features to meet everyone’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-problem-to-solve&quot;&gt;The problem to solve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff scheduling is a very complex process in which a scheduler needs to include many different variables and inputs and come up with the best schedule at the same time making sure that all company operations are adequately covered at all times. However, each reader who tried to coordinate any group of people to do something as a team knows that it can be a hectic process that quite frequently leads to someone being unhappy about the time, date, place, or anything else along that line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to streamline that process to a pipeline where such variables are semi or fully automated, presented to the scheduler at the time of schedule creation at a glance, software engineers and developers have come up with various techniques while building employee scheduling assistance tools. So have ours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/schedule-communicate-deliver-report.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling on Steroids&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-benefits&quot;&gt;The benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results across companies from various industries using cloud scheduling tools are more than amazing. Not only do tools like NimbleSchedule take away stress from the manager or scheduler working on the staff schedule but they also boosts employee engagement and increase productivity rapidly. Furthermore, various reminders and mobile apps that come along with cloud scheduling platforms help employees stay on top of their schedule and significantly reduce the rate of late arrivals and absenteeism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By enabling employees to set their own availabilities, request time off or do all sorts of shift routines, like shift trading, finding replacements or dropping shifts boost the morale of the team significantly. Such semi-automated systems also reduce the amount of work performed by the management for last minute changes while making sure that all staff members are notified on time about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-makes-nimbleschedule-so-different-from-others&quot;&gt;What makes NimbleSchedule so different from others?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule features various options and functionalities for many different industries, which makes it widely acceptable among many business models.  In addition, not only is our system heavily used in retail, healthcare, hospitality, restaurant/bar industry but also in many government agencies, non-profits and universities and colleges. The highly customizable settings section allows many different features to be enabled or disabled, making our system a powerful staff scheduling transformer available 24/7 via the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various built-in notifications (email or SMS), smart phone apps, different time tracking techniques and technologies, a rich reporting system with a supreme payroll reporting make our system stand out from the crowd of similar tools. Easy to use shift repeating patterns, schedule templates mixed with mass editing or shift creating tools buff up our system like it’s on steroids.
The next step?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Primary Administrator Change</title>
   <link href="/blog/primary-administrator-change/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-17T06:05:54-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/primary-administrator-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All companies have some staffing changes occasionally. Whether the reason is because an employee or the manager left the company, got promoted to a higher role or simply his priorities shifted to other duties, from time to time different tasks need to be re-assigned to another team, member or manager. In B2B SaaS world, hence, it is extremely important to be able to meet such changes made by client companies and switch the account ownership and management to another manager or IT person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With B2C software there simply won’t be such a requirement, because there’s rarely a reason why a person would switch his account to another person. In rare occasions when there is such a need, it is much easier to just create a different account rather than to switch it to someone else. In B2B world, things are different. This is why our engineering team and developers made this process super easy and straightforward with NimbleSchedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule fully supports multiple administrators, managers and schedulers within the same company. However, there is only one person considered as the “Primary admin” or simply the account owner. Such a role can be easily re-assigned to another admin by the existing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Primary-Admin-Change.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Primary-Admin-Change-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Primary Administrator Change&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the primary admin navigates to the My Account link in the top right corner of the panel and clicks on the “Company information” page on the left hand side menu, among all other options available to be adjusted, the “Primary admin” section will be displayed as well. All that needs to be done by the existing primary administrator is to select a different admin name from the drop down menu and simply save the page. From that moment the primary administrator role is being held by another admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getapp-ranks-nimbleschedule-as-top-employee-scheduling-solution&quot;&gt;GetApp Ranks NimbleSchedule as Top Employee Scheduling Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlsbad, CA: &lt;/strong&gt; NimbleSchedule, a leading cloud-based workforce optimization software, announced today that it made it to the top tier of GetApp’s quarterly ranking of the top 25 employee scheduling apps on the market. GetApp, the largest cloud-based business app marketplace, gave NimbleSchedule a score of 63 placing it in the top 5 apps of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each app is scored using five criteria, each worth 20 points, for a total possible score of 100. The criteria include: security, integrations, mobile, reviews, and media. Every single app’s GetRank score is completely independent of commercial interests and existing relationships that GetApp has with app vendors. NimbleSchedule received the following scores in GetRank’s criteria: 16 for security, 15 for integrations, 15 for mobile, 12 for reviews and 5 for media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;GetApp co­founder Christophe Primault stated in their press release that &quot;HR solutions are essential in helping an employer effectively manage current and future employees, whether with training, scheduling, or booking time off. Regardless of whether these functions are bundled as an all-in-one solution or are offered as a standalone product, HR applications need to be able to interact and integrate with each other in order to reduce the amount of time that a company spends on routine HR tasks.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Reaching the top of GetRank&#39;s top 25 employee scheduling apps is a great honor for all of us at NimbleSchedule,&quot; said Sasha Poljak, NimbleSchedule CEO. &quot;We wouldn’t be where we are today without the great reviews and feedback from our customers, as well as all the work that has gone into making our technology intuitive and seamlessly integrated with some of the best systems in the SaaS industry.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Allowing Employees to Drop Shifts</title>
   <link href="/blog/allowing-employees-to-drop-shifts/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-11T05:32:18-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/allowing-employees-to-drop-shifts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When working with teams of employees, particularly with larger groups of staff members, a certain level of flexibility in their schedule is always to be expected. No matter how strict your company policy may be concerning this topic, once in a while an employee will have to trade a shift, or have someone else cover for his shift. Finding coverage or the right person to trade the shift with is a time consuming process and it usually involves a lot of phone calls among employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to offer more flexibility, especially to those companies where employees do not work from the same location, or to the ones having a lot of employees that could possibly cover an empty shift slot, our team designed the “Drop shift” option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a completely optional feature, you can enable shift dropping by checking the “Employees can drop shifts” option in the Settings section, “Schedules” sub-option. Once you do that, besides trading shifts and finding coverage, your employees will have the third option that allows them to submit a drop shift request. Now, no need to panic, that’s just a request that still needs an approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/drop-shift.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/drop-shift-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling - Drop Shifts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While requesting to drop a shift, an employee will also be able to fill in the reason for dropping that shift from his schedule. Once an employee fills that in, the request comes to the manager or administrator for an approval. The manager will be able to see which shift is dropped and the reason for that. By all means, the manager will have an option to approve or reject such a request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• If the manager decides to reject a drop shift request, an employee that sent a request will be notified about it and will definitely know that he still needs to work during that shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• If the manager decides to approve a drop shift request, then an employee is again notified and the shift automatically goes from his schedule into the Open Shifts area. Once that happens, the manager has two choices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To leave that shift in the open shift area for other employees who are eligible to pick up to apply on their own;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To manually re-assign that shift from the open shift stack to another employee who has the right role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the drop shift request gets approved by the manager, the system will notify all available employees and then, they can apply to pick up that shift. Instead of having an employee have a bunch of emails or phone calls with his co-workers in an attempt to find someone who could cover for him, you can let the system do the work for your team.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Using software that is easily accessible by all your team members whenever you use a company-wide tool is one of the greatest qualities of cloud-based systems. All your employees need is a browser and they are good to go. However, another thing that makes the SaaS industry so popular is the possibility for different product vendors to integrate with each other. Nowadays it is not enough to have a great standalone tool; it needs to interact with other cloud tools in order to make companies using it blossom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/feeling-saasy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SaaS API Integrations at Its Finest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time to Fire Someone? – We’ve got your back!</title>
   <link href="/blog/keeping-employee-work-history/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-09T07:19:47-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/keeping-employee-work-history</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why sometimes an employee just doesn’t fit into the team or shows poor performance in assigned tasks. Of course, there are employees who perform quite well, but after a while they become tired of their job or they receive a better offer from another company and they decide to leave. No matter what the reason might be, the work history and time tracking records should be kept in the archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping the complete work history of all the shifts and time records for those employees who end up leaving your company, either on their own or after being fired, can be both time and resource consuming and, ultimately, it leads to unnecessary expenses. Quite often when an employee gets fired or leaves a company on bad terms, he may start some legal or procedural actions which will require a company in question to prove either the shift history or the time punches or wages paid to the employee. Easy access to such data may be crucial in cases like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/suspended-and-terminated-accounts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Keeping Employee Work History&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, when an employee leaves or gets fired, the history remains - indefinitely. We will never clear your data from our system as long as you are a client of ours. With that said, all you need to do when someone leaves your company, willingly or not, is to “terminate” their account in our system and that’s it. By terminating or, put in other words, by suspending their account to NimbleSchedule, you get to keep the complete history of shifts, requests, time clock punches and payroll reports for such an employee. Accessing such data whenever you need it is simple and easy and you can do it at any moment. No matter what kind of info you need from the system, you can retrieve it by using an employee’s name and a date range - the same you would do for an active employee in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sweeten the deal as much as possible, we won’t even charge you for terminated/suspended employee accounts. Namely, when your employee leaves the company, even for a couple of months, you can suspend their access to the system while keeping the complete work history. Why would you pay for accounts that are not being used? You pay just for what you need! That’s our policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to make life simpler and easier to business owners and company managers, our engineering team continues to develop ways to help companies on their paths of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You haven’t tried our system yet? &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.nimbleschedule.com/account/create&quot;&gt;Try it completely free&lt;/a&gt;, for 14 days!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why SaaS and Not Desktop Software</title>
   <link href="/blog/why-saas-and-not-desktop-software/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-04T07:07:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/why-saas-and-not-desktop-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The popularity of Software as a Service (SaaS) tools is on the rise. To be more precise, the SaaS industry measures exponential growth and leads in many market niches over the more traditional desktop software. So, the question may be posed: why is cloud better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/reasons-to-consider-saas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Why SaaS And Not Desktop Software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• With cloud software, there is no need to worry about local hardware and infrastructure. Since you do not have to maintain the local computer or server where the software app is hosted, the costs are significantly lower. Moreover, there is no need to spend money on any hardware upgrades, maintenance or similar. Cloud providers will handle that on their end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• SaaS offers better and easier accessibility. In most cases, all you need is a browser to access the cloud app. Such low requirements make cloud apps extremely popular due to high coverage when it comes to all those different devices you could use to access them. Usually no special plug-ins or add-ons are needed on your computer or smart phone to access a cloud app. You just need the Internet connection and you are good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• There is no need to worry about upgrades or bug fixes. Occasionally software developers release a new version of their software or patches for found bugs and issues. With SaaS there is almost nothing you need to do on your end to complete that. A cloud software developer will perform all upgrades on their end, letting you dedicate your precious time to more important things. No more downloads, installations and tricky step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade your software and worrying whether or not your data will be damaged or corrupted at the end of the installation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• SaaS platforms offer simple and easy integrations with different tools. While some desktop software types occasionally offer different plug-ins for their tool, cloud platforms are much more flexible when it comes to various API integrations. Building a powerful network of tools that can help you run your business on various aspects is no longer a hassle. You can integrate your favorite POS system with your scheduling platform, along with your HR and Payroll systems and have all those systems talk to each other while syncing your data in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Cloud systems require less initial costs. Since SaaS is almost always subscription-based, there is no expensive license purchasing involved at the beginning. You simply pay as you go. In case you change your mind and conclude that some specific system is not that useful for your needs as you initially thought it would be, you can just cancel it and minimize the amount of money wasted on such piece of software. With desktop software, once you pay for the license, you are stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could continue naming different pros of using the SaaS for your business needs, but we’d love to hear from you how SaaS improved your business process and helped you save your money and time. If you have any comments or opinions to share with us, please do not hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/&quot;&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quick and Efficient Shift Trading</title>
   <link href="/blog/quick-and-efficient-shift-trading/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-03T06:08:31-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/quick-and-efficient-shift-trading</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the age of technology it would be a pity if an employee still had to pick up the phone and call 5 or 10 co-workers to ask them to replace him on the shift or trade two shifts in case of an emergency or anything similar. Apart from being a waste of time, this process quite often puts a person in an unpleasant position where he needs to call colleagues one by one and ask them to trade shifts. With the rise of popularity of cloud scheduling tools that problem is now resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already a NimbleSchedule user, then you are probably familiar with functionalities it offers.  On the other hand, the level of customization in our workforce management system frequently offers some functionalities under the hood that you perhaps haven’t discovered yet. By adjusting the settings section, you can instruct the system to either automatically allow shift trading among your employees, as long as both sides agree to trade shifts or make that process a bit more formal and set the system to require an administrator’s or manager’s approval at the end of that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shift-trading.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shift-trading-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quick and Efficient Employee Shift Trading&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requesting to trade shift with another employee is an easy thing to do from an employee’s point of view. While viewing the shift, an employee can request to trade each of those shifts for another employee’s shift, which will be automatically listed by the system. Furthermore, if needed, the system administrator can configure the system to even allow shift trades among employees working in different positions. Although this is not such a frequently used option, we’re sure you’ll appreciate that there is such an option built-in in case you need it. By default, the system will allow shift swaps among employees working in the same department on the same position. Plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your employees prefer to use smart phone apps instead of web panel? No problem. By using their Android phone or iPhone, your employees can check their schedule and request to trade shifts from their phone, at any time, from any place. Just by clicking on a specific shift and then selecting an option to trade that specific shift, your employee can now request to trade a shift from his car, a restaurant or any other place. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easy Employee Attendance Approval</title>
   <link href="/blog/easy-employee-attendance-approval/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-02T08:02:26-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/easy-employee-attendance-approval</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to manage your staff better and easier, you need the right set of tools and apps to organize your administrative duties, especially the repetitive ones. As usual, this is where NimbleSchedule comes into play and handles some of your work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our Time Tracking system, your employees can clock in and out for their work shifts by using many different methods:
• Clock in/out by using web panel/computer
• Clock in/out by using smart phone (Android or iPhone)
• Clock in/out by using Text messages
• Clock in/out by using phone call-in
• Clock in/out by using QR code scan app with iPad or Android tablet
• Clock in/out by using biometric/fingerprint devices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, things do not have to be complicated. You can choose one or two methods and have your employees easily punch in for their shifts. On your end, things will be very simple and easy to monitor and supervise. Once your employees punch in and out for their shifts, those timesheet records will be available for your supervision and approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the &lt;em&gt;“Timesheets”&lt;/em&gt; page, you’ll be able to see those entries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/timesheets-approval.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/timesheets-approval-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Attendance Approval&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using icons on the right, you can perform certain actions on such employees’ timesheet entries. The first icon you see there is used for approval. The grey check-mark icon means that the entry is not yet approved. As soon as you click on it, the color of that icon will turn into green and that will mean that your employee’s timesheet entry is now approved. Next to the approval icon you’ll also notice a pencil icon, through which you can edit each entry, and a trash icon which allows you to delete each entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approving time clock entries one by one may sometimes be required if you wish to make sure that every employee clocked in for the right amount of hours. On the other hand, if you prefer to automatically approve everything without going through each entry separately, then you can use the &lt;em&gt;“Approve All”&lt;/em&gt; button above the list. This process will certainly save you a lot of time which you can put into much better use.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Open Shift Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/open-shift-management/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-27T01:55:35-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/open-shift-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quite often, while creating the weekly or monthly schedule, the manager or administrator knows in advance which shifts need to be covered. However, which employee would be the best fit and who will be available that far ahead may or may not be known. The concept behind our “Open Shifts” functionality is that HR managers have a stack of pre-defined shifts that may be re-assigned to employees later on through one of many available methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an open shift is not so different from creating any other shift that you plan to assign to an employee straight away. Instead of clicking on the row where you see your employee’s name on the weekly schedule, you can just click on the first row next to the “Open Shifts” label and create a shift without assigning it to a specific employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Open-Shift-Creation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Shift Creation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create an open shift, you can leave it unassigned until you make a decision to whom it will be assigned, or you can leave it for your employees to apply to pick-up that shift on their own. If you decide to allow your employees to pick-up available open shifts, then only the ones whose position and department match the data set for the open shift will be eligible to apply to pick-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for employees, they’ll have two ways to pick up available open shifts that match their job role defined in the system (position/department combination).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Applying to pick-up Open Shifts from the schedule page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Open-Shift-Pick-up1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Open-Shift-Pick-up1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Shifts Pick-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the “My Schedule” page, an employee can click on the “Open Shifts” button above the schedule and view all available open shifts for his job role in the system for that specific week. In order to apply for any available open shift in the system, an employee can simply click on the “Pick-up” button and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Applying to pick-up Open Shifts from the Requests section&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Open-Shift-Pick-up2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Open-Shift-Pick-up2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Shifts Pick-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case an employee would like to cover a wider range of Open Shifts, instead of having to go week by week to see available open shifts, the “Shifts available for Pick-up” page is the right place for him. Once an employee clicks on the “Requests” section, “Shifts available for Pick-up” will be available on the menu on the left. From there, applying to pick-up an open shift is quite easy and requires an employee to simply click on the “Pick-up” link next to each available open shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the manager will always have the final say. All such open shift pick-up requests will come to the manager for an approval who’ll be able to see all employees that applied to pick-up each shift and make a decision on which request should be approved and which rejected. In case there’s more than one employee applying to pick-up an open shift, the manager will have a chance to select the preferred one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Shift Reminders via Email and SMS</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-shift-reminders/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-26T07:20:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-shift-reminders</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is a proven fact that companies frequently lose a substantial amount of money due to their employee absences or late arrivals to work. While sometimes that’s an intended result of unsatisfied or frustrated employees, or even lazy ones, most of the time such things happen by pure accident - either an employee forgets that he is scheduled for the shift or he simply misunderstands the exact time when the shift is supposed to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help companies cope with this kind of issue, we at NimbleSchedule designed a couple of very useful tools that will help employees stay on top of their schedule and work duties. Among those tools, the most useful feature proven to reduce the number of no shows and late arrivals is the shift reminder option that comes in a couple of variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been a NimbleSchedule user for a while, then you are definitely familiar with the fact that there are many different types of notifications each user in the system can choose to enable or disable. Among other things, an employee can choose to enable shift reminders via Email or SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Employee-Shift-Reminders.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Employee-Shift-Reminders-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Reminders via Email and SMS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the screenshot above, an employee can choose to receive “Upcoming Shift Reminder - 24 hours” or “Upcoming Shift Reminder – 60/90/120 minutes” via Email and/or SMS. Even though both options are more or less self-explanatory, let us point out the key values of both options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Upcoming Shift Reminder - 24 hours”&lt;/strong&gt; – By enabling this type of notification, you will receive a shift reminder 24 hours before your shift starts. Depending on your preference, you may receive this reminder via email or text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Upcoming Shift Reminder – 60/90/120 minutes”&lt;/strong&gt; – If you decide to enable this type of shift reminder, you’ll be able to set it to alert you either 60, 90 or 120 minutes before your shift starts. As mentioned earlier, depending on your personal preference, you may choose to receive this notification via email or SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to missed shifts or late arrivals due to pre-occupied thoughts of your everyday-life. Set one of these shift reminders and spend some quality time with your family or friends without having to worry about the time before your shift starts. Let our employee scheduling system do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule's Integration With Gusto Will Make Your Payroll Process Ridiculously Simple and Easy</title>
   <link href="/blog/nimbleschedules-integration-with-gusto/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-24T09:04:04-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/nimbleschedules-integration-with-gusto</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the rise of popularity of cloud systems, it has become extremely important that you make all your necessary and favorite cloud tools talk to each other in order to make your work day easier. Among all those different systems - HR, Payroll, Time Tracking or Employee Scheduling - there has to be a certain point where all of them can sync and work together. NimbleSchedule is that glue that keeps everything together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our integration with Gusto, cloud-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/gusto-payroll-software-integration-adjustment-payroll-service-done-easily/&quot;&gt;payroll software&lt;/a&gt;, will save you time, money and nerves when the payroll time comes. Namely, Gusto, formerly known as Zenpayroll, provides a simple and easy to use payroll system that allows companies to handle their employee payroll process in no time. Hence, our integration with Gusto is one of the key elements to synchronize your employees’ time clock entries in just a couple of steps and execute the payroll process with no hassle whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gusto-Integration.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gusto-Integration-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gusto Integration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you navigate to our Application Integrations page through the “My Account” section, connect your NimbleSchedule account with your Gusto account. Then, link your employee profiles on both ends and sync your payroll data in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Export-to-Gusto.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Export-to-Gusto-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Export to Gusto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you have all your employees linked to their respective Gusto profiles, navigate to the Payroll report page in the Reports section and select your preferred options for the Export. You can choose between multiple locations, employees and you can select different overtime calculations. Once you are ready, click on the “Generate” option and select the “Export to Zenpayroll” option. Your data will be synced over to Gusto and you are almost done. After you re-check the data through Gusto and confirm that everything looks good, you can complete your payroll process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tedious process of entering all the data manually across various systems is part of the history. Synchronization between NimbleSchedule and Gusto saves time and money for your company or organization. There is no need to waste your precious time on such administrative tasks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Time-Off Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-time-off-management/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-21T10:07:13-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing your employees’ time off requests and coordinating your team’s productivity accordingly can sometimes be a true challenge without the right set of tools that would help you stay organized. In order to track how many employees you have available for certain days and shifts, you definitely need an easy to use and intuitive overview panel with options to monitor, edit and approve all feature requests coming from your team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/employee-time-off-management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Time Off Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely where NimbleSchedule jumps in to save the day. In order to schedule your employees as needed, but at the same time avoid a situation where you would have too many employees taking their time off at the same time, NimbleSchedule may be of tremendous help. By using our automated time-off request system, your employees can easily request days off, or at least part of the day, anytime even beyond work hours. Such requests come to the manager or administrator for an approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Add-Time-Off.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Add-Time-Off-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Add Time Off Request&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When submitting a time off request, an employee can select the starting date along with the ending date and he can also enter the reason for his request. The manager will be notified about such a request and he may choose to edit it, approve or reject it. Apart from showing all the time-off request details, the system will also show any conflicting shifts with such a request, if an employee has some shifts during that time covered by the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a mechanism, the manager can always stay on top of the scheduling process by seeing in advance which shifts will need additional coverage due to the submitted time off request. On the other hand, such time off days will be clearly visible and blocked out on the schedule for such a person. This prevents schedulers and managers from booking someone for the shift by mistake when that person is on vacation. This kind of functionality clearly saves time and money for companies by eliminating any kind of scheduling errors and conflicts and, above all, it minimizes confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Time Tracking via Text Messaging</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-time-tracking-via-text-messaging/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-20T02:58:11-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-time-tracking-via-text-messaging</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of the modern employee time tracking systems cover the basics. You get your employee to use his computer to open the panel, clock in or clock out and that’s it. However, what happens if your employee does not have a computer? Or if he works in the field without a possibility to bring his computer along? Or what happens if your employee simply doesn’t use a smart phone with an internet connection, which prevents him from using most of the existing time tracking systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing employee clocking-in via text messaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, you can choose to activate this great add-on feature for a very reasonable fee (only $1.50 per user, per month) and have your employees without the computer or smart phone access clock in and out by sending an SMS/text message. No fancy computer or smart phone knowledge is required. Today everyone knows how to send an SMS message. This functionality brings time clocking closer to the companies that had challenges with more traditional methods and improves employee time and attendance tracking for all those industries where employees do not necessarily work behind an office desk with the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Time-Clock-via-SMS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Tracking via Text Messaging (SMS)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that you do not need to active this feature for all your employees. You can select just the ones who really need this option and have everyone else use some of our other time tracking methods. Therefore, you pay just for the service you need, for the employees you need, and you do not waste your money with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you activate this service and allow your employees to clock in and out via SMS, all you need to ensure is that your employee has a 4 digit (minimum) employee ID number assigned to his/her profile and you are good to go. Your employee can easily clock in with our system by sending an SMS message to +1 858-240-5817 with a text “IN 1234” (where 1234 is your employee’s id assigned through the profile). For clocking out, your employee can send “OUT 1234” and that’s it. A simple, easy and hassle free time tracking method for you and your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-09-19T10:06:34-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/the-epson-integration-internet-buzz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are subscribed to our blog and newsletter, then you are probably already informed about our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/company-news/epson-strategic-partnership/&quot;&gt;strategic partnership with Epson America&lt;/a&gt;. Having such a valuable partner is a great honor for us as a company, but more importantly, it is a significant addition to the flexibility and usability of our cloud-based scheduling and time tracking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday morning, September 16th, the news about this strategic integration of ours has hit the most renowned internet news portals. Websites like CNNMoney, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/epson-nimble-alliance-idUSnPnb0qHlk+84+PRN20150915&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/news/epson-announces-strategic-partnership-nimble-090000748.html&quot;&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt; and many others broadcast this great news to their audience. What a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/epson-integration-buzz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Strategic Partnership with EPSON America, Inc.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, more than 250 different news portals released this fantastic news which has reached more than 180 million readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that we are just pleased with the level of interest shown regarding our integration with Epson America would be an understatement. Actually, we are thrilled to see the fruits of our hard work and effort publicly affirmed and awarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning for us. NimbleSchedule will continue to grow as new feature enhancements and improvements are continuously being made, which will allow our client base to have an even better friend in our intuitive shift planning and time &amp;amp; attendance software.

   <title>Employee Communication Tools</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-communication-tools/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-13T09:12:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-communication-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every person that tried to manage a larger group of employees will confirm that this can be an exhausting and hectic process. No matter how good your organizational skills are, sooner or later some sort of miscommunication between employees may occur. For those few lucky ones, however, that doesn’t happen when struggling to meet a deadline or satisfy an important client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with many other aspects, we tried to help here with a couple of useful built-in functionalities. Communication between managers and employees, or among employees  themselves does not have to be so hard anymore. Let us present to you two major features in our workforce optimization system that will make your employee management much easier and less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;announcements&quot;&gt;Announcements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an important piece of info to broadcast to your employees, or at least to just a few of them, then you will love our Announcements feature. By posting an announcement, you’ll be able to post your message to all your employees, just managers or just employees working at a certain location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/post_announcement.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/post_announcement-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Communication Tools - Post Announcement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your employees login to the system, they’ll be able to read this announcement on their dashboard. Apart from that option, depending on their notification preferences, your employees will also be notified about new announcements via email or SMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-messages&quot;&gt;Private messages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides posting an announcement, you can also communicate with your employees by sending them direct messages. These direct messages can be sent to a group of employees or just to specific individuals. When sending a message to a group of employees, you can choose whether you wish to send to employees working on a specific position/job role or in a specific department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/new_message.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/new_message-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Communication Tools - Private/Direct Messages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with announcements, these direct messages will be dispatched to your employees via email and/or SMS, depending on their notification preferences. Employees can also reply to those messages and communicate with their managers, or internally if your company decides to allow that option.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Saving Time with Employees’ Repeating Schedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/repeating-schedule/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-11T02:55:31-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/repeating-schedule</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Business owners and managers of rapidly growing companies quite frequently feel they spend too much time on re-occurring administrative and employee scheduling tasks which takes them away from the actual focus of their companies.  That’s why our engineers and developers brained up a whole set of features and tools that can help you automate that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;repeating-employee-shift-patterns&quot;&gt;Repeating Employee Shift Patterns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creating a shift for any of your employees, you can easily select one of many repeating patterns. When you select the preferred one and you publish or save your shift, that same shift will be repeated as many times as you want. This will save you from a lot of manual work needed for repeating the same process of shift creation over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Repeating-Patterns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Repeating Patterns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were looking for an easy way to repeat a single shift for your employee on a daily, weekly or a more complex pattern, then this option is the best choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;copy-to-next-week&quot;&gt;Copy To Next Week&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-creating the whole schedule for your whole team of employees from week to week can cost you a lot of your precious time. There’s no need to waste it anymore on such tasks. With the “Copy To Next Week” tool, you can simply mirror the existing schedule from one week to the next one without any hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CopyToNextWeek.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Copy To Next Week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using this option, the system will clear the schedule from the destination week and copy it over with the set of shifts from the week before. Once the schedule is copied over, you’ll have a chance to tweak it and make it perfect before publishing  as the shifts will be copied over in the draft mode by default. When you are done with making your last minute changes, you can simply publish the schedule for the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-advanced-schedule-template-system&quot;&gt;The Advanced Schedule Template System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of the previous options isn’t fit for your specific needs, this feature probably will. The complex schedule templating system was built to take care of 99% cases when you need a part of the schedule or the full schedule repeated across different weeks, not necessarily in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Templates.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Templates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to build any kind of employee schedule rotation system, then our templating system is your best bet. You can build a whole set of templates, rotate them as needed and apply to any week. Moreover, you can even combine a couple of templates on the schedule for the same week, save custom date ranges or make changes directly on the template itself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Power Edit Staff Info to Save Time</title>
   <link href="/blog/power-edit-staff-info-to-save-time/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-06T01:05:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/power-edit-staff-info-to-save-time</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing a group of employees and balancing their skills and expertise when it comes to tasks can be an extremely complex process. If anything else pops up to that equation, it can cause the manager or supervisor of the team to lose his precious time on sorting out administrative info. When using any kind of cloud system, no matter if it’s an HR, Scheduling, Time Tracking or Payroll, making changes to your employee profiles can take substantial amount of time. Right? Well, not with NimbleSchedule!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making some small adjustments to individual employee profiles is just fine. You just open their profile, navigate to the option you need to change, make the actual change and save the page. Pretty simple and straightforward. However, what happens when you need to alter profiles for 50, 100 or even more employees at the same time? It would be a complete waste of time if you would have to go one profile at a time to make necessary changes, wouldn’t it? This is where our team implemented the so called &lt;strong&gt;“Power Edit”&lt;/strong&gt; option which allows you to make mass profile changes/updates on a single page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Power-Edit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Power-Edit-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Power Edit Staff Info&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the screenshot above, you can easily select a group of employees or even all your employees along with a piece of info you need to mass update for everyone. For example, if you need to enable a single type of notification for all your staff members, that’s a 10-second task with Power Edit. By selecting all employees and the “Schedule published” notification, you’ll be able to edit the setting for that notification for all your employees at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While selecting the type of update you wish to make, you’ll be able to select either an “Individual” or “Group” change. The “Group” change will simply provide you with a single field which you can select or fill in and apply to everyone. With the “Individual” type of update, you’ll get each of your employees listed along with the field next to their name to update or edit. While this may be a bit more time consuming when compared to the “Group” change, it can be useful when you need to make a change for a group of your employees but that change is not the same for all of them. At the same time, editing certain info from a single page should still save you a lot of time because you do not have to click on each of your employee profiles, navigate back and forth and save all that data. With “Power Edit”, you’ll be done in no time!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The growing popularity of our cloud-based scheduling and time tracking system made it interesting for many reviewing websites. One of reputable companies in this niche, TrustRadius, has recently approved the listing of our core product, NimbleSchedule, on their website along with our company’s info and details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TrustRadius specializes in business software reviews that are more than simple comments coming from the community. In order to make the whole review process as transparent as possible, TrustRadius encourages users to use their LinkedIn profiles before they submit their reviews in order to authenticate their identity thus eliminating the risk of potential abuse or fake review coming from unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already a client of ours, please feel free to follow the link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trustradius.com/products/nimbleschedule/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule Reviews on TrustRadius&lt;/a&gt; and write your own review about our workforce management services. Let the world know what you think, because your opinion matters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TrustRadius-NimbleSchedule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Import Employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a fresh new listing, you probably won’t find any reviews listed, so you can very easily be the first person to let the TrustRadius community know about your experience with our web-based scheduling and labor management software. We encourage you to do so. Honesty is the key to success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, our marketing team will continue to collaborate with the online community and trustworthy reviewing websites like TrustRadius in order to spread the word about our online employee scheduling tool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule's Onboarding Made Easy</title>
   <link href="/blog/on-boarding-made-easy/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-30T06:58:57-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/on-boarding-made-easy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No matter if you are moving from another cloud employee scheduling software to NimbleSchedule or if you never used a SaaS system to manage your employees and schedule, our intuitive on-boarding tools and features will make this process super easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manage a team of at least 5-10 employees, then chances are pretty high that you have all their info on file in some list. In case you’ve used excel until now to manage your employees’ work schedule, you are half way done with creating a schedule in our system. All you need to do is to slightly adjust that excel list to the format that our system accepts, and your schedule can be up in the cloud in our schedule maker in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;importing-an-employee-list-via-csvexcel&quot;&gt;Importing an Employee List via CSV/Excel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter if you have your employees’ list on a comma separated list (CSV) or in an Excel file, you can import it into our system in a matter of seconds. Just click on the Employees tab when logged in to the system and from sub-menu options, click on the “Import Employees” option. Once you do that, the system will prompt you to select the employees’ file list from your computer and to specify the columns in your file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NS-Import-Employees.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Import Employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;importing-a-schedule-from-a-csvexcel-list&quot;&gt;Importing a Schedule From a CSV/Excel List&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you already have a pre-determined schedule for your team, or if you perhaps used another scheduling system in the past which allowed you to export your data in a CSV or Excel file format, then you can easily import that into our system. With just a couple of clicks of your mouse, and by mapping your file data columns with the exact data type in our system, you can have your schedule fully imported and operational in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NS-Import-Schedules.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Import Schedules&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule and Facebook - a Perfect Work-Pleasure Symbiosis</title>
   <link href="/blog/facebook-integration/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-29T06:42:35-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/facebook-integration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While many companies are trying to prevent their employees from spending their work hours on social networks, others are seeking ways to put social media networks into use. Besides just pure marketing benefits one can gain from social media networks like Facebook, there are certainly other aspects where such accounts can be used for business purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rapid growth of popularity of social media sites, the need emerged to somehow link pleasure and business and make a winning mix that would help companies and employees operate better at their work duties, or at least to handle certain tasks easier. Having such an idea in mind, our team developed a couple of spots in our employee scheduling system where you can put your Facebook account into good use for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using-your-facebook-account-to-login-to-nimbleschedule&quot;&gt;Using Your Facebook Account to Login to NimbleSchedule&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Log-in-using-Facebook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Log in using Facebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you perhaps already noticed on the login page, apart from logging in to the system with your NimbleSchedule custom selected username and password, you can also use some third party networks to login to your work schedule. One of them is Facebook. In order for you to use your Facebook login details to access your work schedule, all you need to do is to set your email address in NimbleSchedule to match with your email address on your Facebook account and you are good to go. Next time when you try to login, instead of having to remember another set of user login details for NimbleSchedule only, you can use your Facebook login info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Facebook-Work-Calendar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook Calendar Integration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides monitoring your work schedule by logging in to NimbleSchedule, or enabling various email or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/unlimited-sms-messages-add-on/&quot;&gt;SMS notifications&lt;/a&gt;, you can also choose to connect your schedule with certain external calendars in case you use them on a daily basis. One of those external calendars you can put to work is Facebook calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By navigating to the “My Schedule” page in the “Schedules” section, you can click on the blue Facebook icon above your schedule and have all your shifts synced with your Facebook calendar. As soon as you connect that option, all your future shifts published by your manager will appear on your Facebook calendar. If you frequently use Facebook, this may be a great option for you to be notified about all your shift changes or new shift assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Goodbye to “Buddy Punching” & Hello to Biometric Time Clocks</title>
   <link href="/blog/biometric-time-clocks/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-28T06:32:26-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/biometric-time-clocks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following the demand on the market, we at NimbleSchedule developed an integration with a whole set of biometric devices, specifically fingerprint scanners, which help companies achieve better payroll accuracy and prevent “Buddy punching”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Biometric-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Biometric Time Clocks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the whole list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.nimbleschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/203755096-Fingerprint-scanners-for-time-attendance&quot;&gt;supported fingerprint scanners&lt;/a&gt;, our development and engineering teams made a bold step in helping companies put a stop to “buddy punching” and improve their payroll process without any possibility for a potential abuse as with some other, more traditional time clocking methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fingerprint scanners are very easy to configure and use. Once you connect one to a computer, you can have your employees clock in / out with their fingerprint in no time. As fingerprint scanners are extremely efficient and accurate, you can minimize any delays during the clock in process for your early morning shifts, and have a whole group of your employees clocked in and ready for work in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking time and attendance accurately and efficiently can mean the difference between running a successful business operation or failing to achieve your business goal. Stop losing money with “free-minded” employees and their “buddy punching” wizardry, and re-gain full control of your company’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in setting up this time&amp;amp;attendance; system for your business, please do not hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unlimited SMS Messages Add-on</title>
   <link href="/blog/unlimited-sms-messages-add-on/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-23T08:01:34-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/unlimited-sms-messages-add-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest update release brought the separation of NimbleSchedule into two modules: Scheduling and Time Tracking. Another very attractive feature that came out with Version 6.22 is &lt;strong&gt;the unlimited texting notifications add-on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all enterprise accounts in our system, the “Communication via Text Message (SMS)” comes completely free. With this add-on activated, you and your employees can receive an unlimited number of text messages during the month without any additional cost being charged to your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Employee-Notification-Preferences.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Employee-Notification-Preferences-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Notification Preferences&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the companies using our Standard plan, as they don’t need all the features of the Enterprise plan, can activate this option as an add-on. If you are interested in activating this option, then please login to your account, click on the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the page and from there click on the “Feature Add-ons” link on the left hand side menu. Once there, among other add-on options, you’ll notice the “Communication via Text Message (SMS)” along with all the necessary info and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our text message functionality covers more than 190 countries, so if your team is composed of employees spread around the globe, or your company simply has locations in different countries, then you do not need to worry about the coverage. Simply have your employees enable notifications they wish to receive via SMS and that’s it. No matter where they are in the world, they will be notified via SMS about any schedule changes, private messages or company announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Security Enhancements</title>
   <link href="/blog/security-enhancements/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-21T08:30:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/security-enhancements</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a large number of employees and users in any system, the risks of various abuses are fairly high. This is why our development team made extra security enhancements that come along with the latest version of our workforce management software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the certificate change and some coding improvements that are not visible to end users, here is a list of visible changes that will make any potential abuse next to impossible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The system now requires all users to use strong passwords
• The system now requires users to enter the existing password in order to change it to a new one
• After 10 unsuccessful login attempts, the system will now block the user for 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SecurityEnhancements.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SecurityEnhancementsFeatured.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Security Enhancements&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong passwords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a password for an account in our employee schedule maker, a user is now required to enter a minimum of 6 characters, to use at least one CAPS letter, at least one number and at least one symbol (e.g. %$@!). With such an improved password policy, hacking of accounts is no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entering the existing password when changing it to a new one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This improvement aims to prevent any kind of abuse for those employees or administrators working from corporate offices. How easy would it be for another coworker to approach his colleague’s work station and change his password while that person is not looking - just for pranking purposes? Now, that’s impossible. When trying to change the account password, the system also requires each user to enter the existing password in order to set the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brute force hacking prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent any kind of so-called “brute force” login attempts with dictionary hacking scripts trying to guess any user’s password over and over until they succeed, our engineering and development teams implemented a limit for the number of unsuccessful login attempts. If any user tries to login to the system with at least 10 or more unsuccessful attempts, the system will automatically prevent any further attempts for the period of 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule UI Improvements</title>
   <link href="/blog/ui-improvements/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-19T08:02:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/ui-improvements</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to make our interface as easy and intuitive for use as possible, we are constantly making some UI improvements. This includes our latest update release that came along with a couple of tweaks that should make your employee scheduling process much faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Clock on the Dashboard page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious changes we made to the user interface is the time clock option which we added to the dashboard section. This covers all user roles in the system, so no matter if you are an employee or the manager, you’ll be able to clock in or out for your shift directly from the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dashboard-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dashboard-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Clock on the Dashboard page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short shift blocks handling throughout different pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better handling of short shift blocks, especially those that last for less than 60 minutes, we made a lot of improvements throughout different pages of the system. This includes weekly and daily views for employees on their “My Schedule” page. Additionally, some tweaks also covered the Daily view of the “Everyone’s schedule” page for administrators and managers. For really short shifts you’ll now notice that the system will display a tooltip with the full shift info while hiding the text from the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Short-Employee-Shift-Handling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Short-Employee-Shift-Handling-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Short shift blocks handling throughout different pages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timesheet filtering within a certain time span&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides filtering timesheets within a certain date range, or just from a specific location, the filter in the system now also allows you to select a specific time range along with the date. By using this functionality, you can easily filter out just your AM or PM shifts, or any other time frame from the selected period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Timesheet-Filtering.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Timesheet-Filtering-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Timesheet filtering within a certain time span&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more Nimble news!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>BambooHR PTO Upgrade</title>
   <link href="/blog/bamboohr-pto-upgrade/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-11T08:05:27-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/bamboohr-pto-upgrade</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wanting to make life easier with hassle-free payroll, we included &lt;strong&gt;the PTO feature&lt;/strong&gt; in the latest release of our software. For the time being, this feature is working as a natural extension of our system integration with BambooHR. The payroll report will no longer include just employees’ hours from the time clock but also their approved PTO hours, thus making processing payroll much easier and more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bamboohr.com&quot;&gt;BambooHR&lt;/a&gt; for your company needs, then you are probably already aware that NimbleSchedule and BambooHR synchronize seamlessly and flawlessly. With such a powerful and reliable integration, you can cover almost the full scope of your company’s needs regarding workforce management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BambooHR-widget.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BambooHR-widget-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BambooHR PTO&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already syncing approved time off requests from BambooHR to NimbleSchedule, there’s nothing you need to do in order to enable this new option.  If that’s not the case, make sure you do that. As soon as you have both systems “talking”, your employees’ approved PTO hours will flow from BambooHR to NimbleSchedule and you will be able to view and review those hours on the payroll report page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
The synchronization with BambooHR runs every 60 minutes, so once you make any change through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bamboohr.com&quot;&gt;BambooHR&lt;/a&gt;, please give it up to 60 minutes for that data to appear in NimbleSchedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New "Flexible Employee Searching" Feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/flexible-employee-searching/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-10T06:51:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flexible-employee-searching</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to make employee scheduling as easy and efficient as possible. With that in mind, Version 6.22 of NimbleSchedule included several key enhancements aimed at saving you time on recurring tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of these enhancements is **a more flexible and easier-to-use search option through the scheduling interface**.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flexible-Employee-Search.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flexible-Employee-Search.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flexible Employee Searching&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When searching for employees, you can now type just part of a name, or simply the first letter, and the system will return all matching records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This enhancement allows for faster overall scheduling by locating employees in a flash. We hope you enjoy this new functionality.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule's Separation Into Two Modules</title>
   <link href="/blog/nimbleschedules-separation-into-two-modules/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-10T06:17:43-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/nimbleschedules-separation-into-two-modules</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest release of our workforce management system has brought many exciting updates and enhancements, one of them being &lt;strong&gt;the separation of NimbleSchedule into two modules&lt;/strong&gt;: Scheduling and Time Tracking. Do not worry if you need both components because that’s definitely still an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you are an existing client, then you probably haven’t noticed much of a difference when it comes to this separation because you’ll have both Scheduling and Time Tracking enabled by default. However, if you navigate to the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the page, you’ll be able to choose just scheduling or just time tracking from the “Price Plans” page. Disabling one of these modules will simply hide all functionalities related to a particular module.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Scheduling-And-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Scheduling-And-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Separation of NimbleSchedule into Two Modules&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change made to our workforce optimization software enables companies that need just Time Tracking to hide all Scheduling components and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Accordingly, the newly adopted pricing structure is fair to all clients. Those who need to use just one module, either Time Tracking or Employee Scheduling, will pay just for the model used, not for both of them. This allows your company to save money you would spend for an unneeded service and to focus on using just the part of the system that you need. Moreover, the ability to switch to either of the offered modules minimizes the confusion in your employees’ rows when it comes to some features being displayed, which your company simply doesn’t need to use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more flexibility offered by our system – &lt;strong&gt;the more power in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;! Happy NimbleScheduling!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New "Daily Coverage Map" Feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/daily-coverage-map/"/>

   <id>/blog/daily-coverage-map</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You spoke, we listened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to help our users better supervise their daily schedule, we designed a new feature called **“Daily Coverage Map”** that provides a daily view of the number of people assigned by the hour, per position. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all those companies that need to ensure full time employee coverage for specific time slots during the day or 24 hours a day, this great new functionality will make supervision of such coverage so much easier for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DailyCoverageMap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DailyCoverageMap-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Daily Coverage Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**1. **Starting with a breakdown of hourly coverage and the number of employees per hour, this new feature enables you to have a clear vision about your schedule coverage per  hour during a certain day. If you want to get more detailed info, you can navigate through a separate table for each position, with employees’ coverage clearly shown both visually and textually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Next to each employee’s row you will see the total number of hours per employee. At the bottom below every table, you will see the total for all employees scheduled for a certain position for the day. The whole page follows the style of the rest of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/&quot;&gt;employee schedule maker&lt;/a&gt;, so we are sure that the layout will be very intuitive and easy to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our development team is working full time on making our software flexible and responsive to your employee scheduling and supervision needs so stayed tuned - things are getting better everyday!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New "Open Shift Scheduling" Per Department Feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/refined-open-shift-scheduling-per-department/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-07T07:25:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/refined-open-shift-scheduling-per-department</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;The ultimate goal of NimbleSchedule version 6.22 was to maintain our system&#39;s simplicity and ease of use, but also add a series of enhancements that increase flexibility and help save you time by speeding-up the scheduling process. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With think our new &lt;strong&gt;Open Shifts Scheduling by Department&lt;/strong&gt; feature delivers on this goal beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while creating an Open Shift, you can refine the shift by position and by department, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/OpenShiftDepartments.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/OpenShiftDepartments.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Shift Scheduling Per Department&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While matching availability for a specific Open Shift, the system will seek through your employee profiles and match the shift availability by both position and department. 

This narrows down the list of employees that can apply to pick up an open shift to just those that you need, and minimizes the amount of approval work that needs to be done.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Note: **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case you don’t need the department functionality, you can simply disable it in your settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also keep the department functionality enabled, but choose not to specify the department option for your Open Shift. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more news about tweaks and feature enhancements like this one!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New "Customized Breaks" Feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/new-better-customized-breaks-system/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-06T06:30:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/new-better-customized-breaks-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest release of our business scheduling software brought numerous patches, updates and feature enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most exciting ones is a new **Breaks System**. It was designed to improve the customization level that can be made for each shift, ensuring much more flexibility for employee schedule management.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the process of transition from the old Break Rules system to the new custom one smooth, we decided to keep both features fully functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; This practically means that you can choose any of these two options and use them as you need them. For example, if you need to create a simple break that applies to all your employee shifts at once, you can continue using our Break Rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; On the other hand, if you need more flexibility with breaks of different length or with the ones starting at different times for each member of your team, then you’ll simply love our new custom break system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enhancement now allows you to create up to two unpaid custom breaks while creating the shift directly in the shift creation popup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CustomScheduleBreaks-NoBreak.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CustomScheduleBreaks-NoBreak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customized Breaks System - Initial Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the screenshot above, the procedure is very simple and intuitive. When you define the shift start time, end time, position and employee (if needed), you can also choose to add one or two unpaid breaks for that specific shift. It’s that simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CustomScheduleBreaks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CustomScheduleBreaks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customized Breaks System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more hassle with organizing your employees’ breaks in order to maintain the shift coverage. You can now simply define those custom breaks on the schedule and use your free time leftover for other duties. Your employees will be able to see those breaks on their schedule and will know exactly when their break starts and ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you wish to use any of our built-in functionalities, like the template system or “Copy To Next Week” feature, or any of our repeating patterns, you don’t need to worry about breaks either. Whichever action you perform on the break (save it as a template, copy it to next week, etc.), the break will be saved or copied along.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Nimble Software Systems, Inc. Introduces New Pricing</title>
   <link href="/blog/new-pricing-model-pr/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-06T01:10:12-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Press-Release-Header_TEMP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Press Release Header_TEMP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nimble-software-systems-inc-introduces-new-pricing&quot;&gt;Nimble Software Systems, Inc. Introduces New Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlsbad, CA: &lt;/strong&gt; Nimble Software Systems, Inc. announced today a new pricing methodology for its NimbleSchedule suite of cloud based staff optimization applications. The revamped pricing model is focused on two key elements: simplicity and transparency for the users of its staff Scheduling and Time Tracking tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;After a careful consideration, we decided to migrate from the level-based pricing to a simpler and more flexible pricing model: per-employee/per-service&quot; said Sasha Poljak, the CEO of Nimble Software Systems, Inc. &quot;The new pricing structure allows businesses to pay only for the active users of the system and the integration level they require.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PricingPage.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PricingPage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Pricing Methodology&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Under the new pricing, we will introduce two user models for this structure called Standard and Enterprise” said Peter Swaniker, the Company&#39;s founder and CTO. “The change ensures that companies having extra needs for third party integrations get dedicated attention from our tech support team as well as an opportunity to integrate with a list of world-class third party apps.” added Mr. Swaniker.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The new pricing model results in savings with subscribers of both Scheduling and Time Tracking products, while ensuring that our existing clients continue with the price plan of their choice.&quot; said Brian Faunce, the Product Manager at Nimble Software Systems, Inc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nimble-software-systems-inc-announces-the-separation-of-nimbleschedule-into-two-modules&quot;&gt;Nimble Software Systems, Inc. Announces the Separation of NimbleSchedule into Two Modules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlsbad, CA: &lt;/strong&gt; Nimble Software Systems, Inc. announced today the separation of its workforce optimization application into two modules: Time Tracking and Employee Scheduling, thus enabling its clients to select and pay for the option(s) they need separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The separation of NimbleSchedule into two stand-alone products was a natural step,&quot; said Peter Swaniker, the CTO of the Company. &quot;Our esteemed clients will now have an opportunity to choose whether they want to use either one, or both modules.  That way they will be able to focus on the service they actually need and use on a daily basis.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Scheduling-And-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Scheduling-And-Time-Tracking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Separation of NimbleSchedule into Two Modules&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Enterprise customers are now provided with independence and flexibility while purchasing our products,&quot; added Sasha Poljak, the CEO of Nimble Software Systems, Inc. &quot;Consequently, we will be in an even better position to compete in the market, support our clients, and deliver them maximum value, which is our ultimate goal.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This fundamental change to the architecture of our workforce management system has been completed in hopes of making life a little easier for all business owners and managers who need just the Time Tracking component, or just the Scheduling one. We aim to please our clients.&quot; stated Chip Hanlon, the Director of Sales at Nimble Software Systems, Inc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule Gets High Marks!</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-review/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-30T13:11:25-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule was recently reviewed on &lt;strong&gt;TopTen Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TopTenReviews.com provides reviews and articles on the best software products on the market. We’re very excited that they decided to check out NimbleSchedule and here is what they had to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;**NimbleSchedule offers one of the most user-friendly interfaces available, which includes a clean dashboard with the current day’s schedule, a snapshot of hours scheduled for the week and number of employees and shifts scheduled, links to the company’s helpful blog and more. The dashboard is a unique feature that makes NimbleSchedule one of the best employee scheduling applications available.**&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TopTen-Reviews-Image-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TopTen-Reviews-Image-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;TopTen Reviews Image 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/8-1-2015-2-50-55-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;8-1-2015 2-50-55 PM&quot; /&gt;It is clear that a clean design is important to the creators of &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt;, an online employee scheduling application that offers one of the most user-friendly interfaces in the industry. Additionally, the Software as a Service (SaaS) model gives businesses – big and small – scheduling software that fits everyone who needs to use it. The tools are easy to use, with attention given to the details of scheduling tasks and automation to help you get work done and move on to more important matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; You can make the employee scheduling software work for you in a variety of ways, from the daily, weekly and monthly scheduling options to the time-off and shift-trade requests section to the basic reports that are available to managers. &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; also offers helpful additional features, including a mobile application for you and your employees, so no one has to wonder who works when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. **&lt;/strong&gt;NimbleSchedule’s** dashboard includes several at-a-glance pieces of information, including an hourly layout of the current day’s schedules and links to helpful articles available on the company’s blog. The scheduling software proves to be one of the best on the market with its numerous tools and time-saving features, which is why it receives our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scheduling-capabilities-9510&quot;&gt;Scheduling Capabilities 9.5/10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule really shines compared with other ranked software in our lineup when you consider the dashboard. The design of the application makes it very easy to go from being a scheduling application amateur to being reasonably adept in a matter of minutes. Tabs at the top of the scheduler make it clear where you are within the program, and it’s easy to switch between schedules, requests and reports. The dashboard gives you an at-a-glance look at the daily, weekly and monthly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily map out hours for all of your employees at all of your locations and then synchronize with other calendars, such as those in Google and Outlook. NimbleSchedule includes a drag-and-drop feature on its calendar; you can simply click, drag and drop one person’s shift to another day. The auto-scheduler further simplifies the process and frees up even more time with a dialog in which you can enter the number of employees needed for a shift and have the application assign workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As user-friendly as the NimbleSchedule interface is, it wasn’t without faults. You can include wages when you’re adding a new employee, but once you hit save, if you haven’t entered wages, the option disappears. You then have to enter wage information through the Positions section. This adds a couple of extra steps, which reduces efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;report-information-9810&quot;&gt;Report Information 9.8/10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond scheduling, you need an online scheduling application that organizes data for you to aid you in improving your business in several areas. You can run reports on employees, schedules and payroll. There are several reports you can run through NimbleSchedule, and there are parts you can customize, but not nearly as many as some others in our top 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;help--support-1010&quot;&gt;Help &amp;amp; Support 10/10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f you run into an issue that you can’t solve by yourself, you may need to seek NimbleSchedule’s help, which comes in several forms. The website has many resources for you to find the answers to your questions or solutions to your problems, including a user forum, a FAQs section and a knowledge-base. In case you need more help than you can find on the website, NimbleSchedule offers a live chat option and customer service representatives you can correspond with by email or phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nimbleschedule-summary-9810&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule Summary: 9.8/10&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You would be hard-pressed to find a more user-friendly interface and powerful scheduling application than NimbleSchedule’s. The company excels at giving its customers the best tools and the best dashboard on the market. Although it doesn’t offer as many reports or as much customization as other services, NimbleSchedule still pulls way ahead of most of the employee scheduling software pack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Importing Employees Into NimbleSchedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/importing-employees/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-28T12:45:34-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/importing-employees</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have tried using some cloud-based systems to manage your workforce, then you are probably aware how time consuming and frustrating the task of entering your employees’ info into that employee portal can be. Any system usually requires fulfillment of a series of steps until you get to the point where you can manually type in your employees’ info and the whole process usually takes one employee at a time. God forbid if you discover that you made some mistakes and that you have to start all over, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**The whole idea behind our employee portal is not only to provide scheduling and time keeping options but also to make it easier for managers to do their job well whereas the main goal is to save both money and time. With that in mind, we perfected the importing process that allows you to import your employees&#39; data via Excel or CSV file.**&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Employee-Import-Example.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Employee-Import-Example-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Import Example File&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter if you have all your employees’ info in a single, or at least in a couple of files, this process will save you tremendous time. The only condition is that you have all your employees’ details separated in columns in an excel file or by a comma in a CSV file. The only mandatory fields are the first and the last name. All other fields are optional so here are some additional ones that you can include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Email
• Phone
• Employee ID
• Address Line 1
• Address Line 2
• City
• State
• Zip
• Country
• Position
• Department
• PayRate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have some other data in your file, you don’t have delete them. While importing your file into our online employee software, you will have a chance to specify which columns to skip, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Import-Employees.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Import-Employees-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Automated Employee Import&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you insert your file into our cloud-based workforce scheduling software and map all the columns from your file to the right data type for our employee portal, it will take just a few seconds to import your whole list. No matter if you have 10, 110 or 1010, our system will flawlessly import your employee info so you can start using our powerful tool right away. It’s that easy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule Seamlessly Integrates with Kounta POS</title>
   <link href="/blog/seamless-integration-with-kounta-pos/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-28T11:04:36-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/seamless-integration-with-kounta-pos</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you operate a retail business, then the chances are high that you are aware of how useful it is to stay on top of all your income versus costs so that you could successfully keep your business running. Unfortunately, excel sheets or various print outs can cause a lot of headaches and they can easily lead you to miss some important pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help you run your retail business easier, our software engineers and developers came up with a perfect solution which allows you to integrate our work schedule software with the Kounta POS system. With such two powerful systems in sync, the outcome is a combination of both the sales and the staffing costs data. And that’s not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have an account with Kounta, then you can easily connect both ends. All you have to do is to navigate to the My Account section; from there click on the Applications and then click on Kounta’s label or logo. The system will take you to your account with Kounta to approve this synchronization. Once you have this step completed you can choose what kind of options you wish to enable for this synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kounta-Widget.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kounta-Widget-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seamless Integration with Kounta POS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you can see on the screenshot above, you can choose to enable one, or both of these available options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Import sales information
• Import staff data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Import sales information&lt;/strong&gt; – This option allows you to automatically sync your sales info from Kounta POS and show it on the chart on the Dashboard page compared with your staffing costs. By using this option, you’ll get a live interface to the sales vs costs comparison at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Import staff data&lt;/strong&gt; – As the name suggests, this option allows you to synchronize your employee info from Kounta into NimbleSchedule. By using this feature, you can skip the step of manually adding your employees into NimbleSchedule or importing them from an excel or a csv file. If you already have your team listed in your Kounta account, then you can simply enable this option and see your staff data automatically synced with our work schedule system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kounta-and-NimbleSchedule-API-Integration.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kounta-and-NimbleSchedule-API-Integration-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule Integration with Kounta POS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This tremendous combination of two very useful tools gives you an amazing interface for easier monitoring of sales income versus staffing costs in real time and helps your company stay on budget while riding on the road of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inviting Employees to Use NimbleSchedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/inviting-employees-to-start-using-nimbleschedule/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-27T10:21:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/inviting-employees-to-start-using-nimbleschedule</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have recently started using NimbleSchedule, you have probably noticed already how easy and effective our time management software is. Within just a couple of minutes you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;add your employees to the system&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;create a schedule&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;run your first reports&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our employee management tool also has time attendance components, your employees will need to access the system, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides their profile management, where they can configure their basic info, set specific notification preferences for the scheduling component or configure their availability, your employees can also swap shifts, request time off, communicate internally between themselves or with the management and many other useful things. Hence, they need to be granted access to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;_**Once you have added all your employees to our time clocking SaaS system or you have synchronized their profiles and info from a third party system, you can distribute their account information to them and invite them to start using the software. No matter if you wish to invite all employees from your account or just a certain group, the procedure is very simple.**_&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NimbleSchedule_Invite-Employees.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NimbleSchedule_Invite-Employees.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule_Invite-Employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to invite everyone from your account, **&lt;/strong&gt;_click _on the “Invite” option above the employees’ list and from the small drop down menu select “All Employees”.**&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you click on that option, an automated email with the necessary information will be sent out to all employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other hand, if you want to invite just a couple of employees first to take a crack at the system, or perhaps just your managers and schedulers, you can select those specific employees from the list, click on the “Invite” option above the list and then on the “Selected Employees” button.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately upon clicking that option, the selected group of users will receive an email with the necessary info to access their NimbleSchedule accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invitation email will contain a secure link where each of your employees can set his/her own password. This email message will also contain their username, so your employees will have all the necessary information to start using the system. Once they set the password, they will be ready to login and explore our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Scheduled vs. Actual Hours Worked</title>
   <link href="/blog/scheduled-vs-actual-hours-worked/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-27T10:07:44-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/scheduled-vs-actual-hours-worked</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to run a successful business, especially when your company starts growing, an important segment of your routine has to be keeping your costs under control. It is so easy to get carried away when customers start coming your way and you start hiring new people that at one moment your staffing and other costs just go over your income. &lt;strong&gt;Now that’s a serious problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a fairly straightforward process to create a work schedule and keep your scheduled costs under control. But between that point and the one when a larger team of employees start clocking in and out of the system, the difference can be huge. In no time, your carefully planned staff budget is thrown out the window and what your team actually clocked in for is way different than what was planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;_**In an attempt to make staffing cost control easier for business owners and managers, our development team designed a whole set of reports and features to help along with that process. One of extremely useful reports, if you use both the scheduling and the time clock component in NimbleSchedule, is “Scheduled vs. Actual Hours Worked”.**_&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scheduled-vs-Actual-Hours-Worked-from-NimbleSchedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Scheduled-vs-Actual-Hours-Worked-from-NimbleSchedule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scheduled-vs-Actual-Hours-Worked from NimbleSchedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the screenshot above, this amazing report page will give you a detailed breakdown for each of your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an explanation of each of those fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Name – Name of your employee&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Date – Date of an entry&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Total Scheduled Hours – Shows the total number of hours for which your employee was scheduled &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Total Hours (from time clock) – Actual number of hours on which your payroll report will be based&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Difference (scheduled vs actual hours worked) – Hours scheduled versus actual hours worked&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Labor cost (scheduled) – Through this column, you’ll see the predicted cost for the scheduled shift&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Labor cost (actual) – This final column on the right will show you the cost of your employee’s time clock entry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the description, through this labor work report you can easily monitor the difference between your planned staffing costs reflected on the schedule and what actually happened when your employees clocked in and out for their shifts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who worked longer than expected?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who worked shorter than planned?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whose longer hours dramatically influenced your planned budget?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these questions can be easily answered after a quick glance of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Location Based Employee Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/location-based-employee-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-27T09:52:46-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/location-based-employee-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing a company with employees across multiple locations can be challenging to even the best managers. Therefore, the following question may be posed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;_**How to effectively manage such employees without using tons of paper and spending hours and hours on such a process?**_&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’ve just discovered NimbleSchedule, then let us mention that among other features, our schedule maker offers an option that will help you manage an unlimited number of locations with your team spread across multiple locations or restricted to just one, when needed. On the other hand, if you have already started using our work schedule tool, stay tuned as there may be a couple of tweaks you’ll find very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start adding your locations to NimbleSchedule and you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;assign your employees to locations where you need them, you’ll notice that the schedule page will be simply filtered per location basis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. One location at a time, you can review schedules and employees assigned to each of your locations. In the top right corner, above the schedule, you’ll notice a drop down with your different locations listed. In case you used our schedule maker with just one location, then please note that as soon as you start adding additional locations, this drop down menu will show up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NimbleSchedule-Locations-Drop-Down.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NimbleSchedule-Locations-Drop-Down.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule-Locations-Drop-Down&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you select another location, the page will refresh and you’ll be able to see a different group of your employees on the schedule. In case one or more of your employees work on multiple locations, then while browsing one location, you’ll be able to see their shifts from other locations as well. This tweak ensures that if you are working on the schedule for one location, you can easily take into consideration the shifts from other locations while scheduling your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to filter out those shifts slightly better, or perhaps review all employees under a single view, do not worry – our experts thought of that as well. Using the filter menu above the schedule, you’ll have a chance to slightly refine your schedule view. We’re going to skip other options and mention just the important ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NimbleSchedule-Filter-Drop-Down.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/NimbleSchedule-Filter-Drop-Down.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule-Filter-Drop-Down&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Show All Employees&lt;/strong&gt; – By enabling this option, your schedule view will be populated with all employees, including those from other locations. This option gives you the ability to have a master schedule function that’s extremely easy to enable or disable. A word of caution: when using this option, use it for reviewing purposes only and not for scheduling, since it shows employees from other locations and not just from the one you are looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Show Only Shifts For Current Location&lt;/strong&gt; – This option allows you to hide all shifts from other locations so you can focus just on your single location. Provided that your employees work on multiple locations, you’ll find this filter option extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>10 Signs You Have a Bad Boss</title>
   <link href="/blog/10-signs-you-have-a-bad-boss/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-24T10:51:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/10-signs-you-have-a-bad-boss</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you frequently find yourself avoiding meeting your boss or manager in the hallway or having your palms sweat when you have a scheduled meeting with him? It probably isn’t comforting to you to know, but over 70% people claim that they have the worst boss ever. Being a bad boss is obviously not that uncommon thing, and it appears to be very easy since many managers achieve that title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some characteristics of a bad boss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Do-you-have-a-bad-boss_NimbleSchedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Do-you-have-a-bad-boss_NimbleSchedule-300x205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Do you have a bad boss_NimbleSchedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Your boss wants to micro-manager everything! Often times managers tend to interpret the phrase “Leading by example” in the wrong way, and decide to micro-manage and do everything on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• He fails to admit his own mistakes. Like any other person, managers and bosses occasionally make mistakes. Failing to take responsibility for actions that led to a mistake or an error is one of the bad boss traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• He brings you down and ruins your self-esteem. Have you ever caught yourself giving your best at what you do and not being appreciated by your manager? If he is constantly putting you down and lowering your work self-esteem, that is a clear sign of having a bad boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Your boss fails to motivate employees. Being the leader of a team or of the whole company, it is up to the manager to keep his employees motivated. When the time comes that the work environment becomes a bit stressful, as it happens from time to time, it is up to the boss to properly motivate his team so that they could overcome all the difficulties and achieve the best possible results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Is your feedback being constantly ignored? What frequently happens is that a boss simply ignores the feedback provided by his employees not even wanting to listen when they express various opinions, especially the ones not matching his own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• He thinks he knows everything. He doesn’t allow anyone to contradict him, always argues to prove himself right, even when that’s not the case and it always has to be his way or the highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Does he inspire you to do perform your job better? A good leader knows how to inspire his team with his own example and ideas. He motivates his team properly and spreads a positive spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• He freaks out and bursts into anger when under stress. A perfect boss needs to keep himself together and be calm at all times. The team should never see their leader freaking out or bursting into anger because he is under stress. A good boss must keep himself cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• He prefers being liked from being a good leader. Achieving a status of a good and well respected manager is hard while being liked by employees is quite easy. All one needs to do is to always take their side, accept all excuses for mistakes and have fun all the time. What about the team’s productivity and success?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• He lacks faith in his team and he rarely delegates. If a leader never delegates any tasks of higher importance to others and lacks faith into his employees, then that clearly makes him a bad boss. Delegating tasks to team members and supervising them throughout is what makes a distinction between a good and a bad manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, being a good boss is not that easy. Even though anyone can fall into any of the previously mentioned traps, acknowledging the made mistakes and showing willingness to improve is the game changer. Leaving the current job and going into a search for a new job is the last thing one would want in this unstable economy. But knowing when to draw the line and realize that there is no other solution is actually the key.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reports: Scheduled vs Actual Hours Worked</title>
   <link href="/blog/reports-scheduled-vs-actual-hours-worked/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-15T08:57:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/reports-scheduled-vs-actual-hours-worked</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule features many useful reports that help you stay on top of your labor productivity as well as your staffing costs. In case you use both the scheduling and the time clock component of our system, then there is one particularly useful report in our “Miscellaneous” section called “Scheduled vs Actual Hours Worked”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, this report allows you to have a clear comparison of the time scheduled for your employees versus the time they were clocked-in using our Time Clock functionality. As with every report in our system, there’s a filter on top of this report. Using the filter on top of the page, you can refine your search and restrict the report to a specific date range, or simply cover the current week or the current month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Scheduled-vs-Actual.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Scheduled-vs-Actual-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Labor productivity report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have selected a proper date range, simply click on the “Generate” button and your employee names along with the data appear in the table below. You’ll notice that the first thing you see in the table on the left are actually employee names, followed by the date of their shift. From left to right, you’ll see Total Scheduled Hours, Total Hours (from time clock), Difference (scheduled vs actual hours worked), Labor Cost scheduled and, finally, Labor cost (actual).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Scheduled Hours&lt;/strong&gt; – this column will show the number of hours for which your employee was scheduled for a particular date. So, in case your employee was scheduled to work from 9AM to 5PM, this column will show 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Hours (from time clock)&lt;/strong&gt; – as opposed to the above-mentioned column, this column refers to the time clock entry and will display the exact number of hours for a selected date when your employee was clocked-in. So, if your employee was clocked in from 10AM to 5PM, then the number in this column should simply show 7 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference (scheduled vs actual hours worked)&lt;/strong&gt; – as the name suggests, this column will simply show the difference between the first two columns. Providing your employee was scheduled for 8 hours, but clocked in for only 7 hours, then this column will show 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labor Cost (Scheduled)&lt;/strong&gt; – displays the cost of all scheduled hours for a shift created for your employee on a specific date. This number gets generated according to the hourly pay rate configured on your employee’s profile multiplied by the number of scheduled hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labor Cost (Actual)&lt;/strong&gt; – displays the cost of all clocked-in hours for your employee on a specific day. The difference from the Scheduled cost is that this multiples your employee’s pay rate with the number of hours from the time clock instead of those hours for which your employee was scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bottom of this table you’ll see the totals for each column. Using these data to cross-reference what was scheduled and what actually happened may help you stay on top of all your staffing costs, business productivity and you will see where exactly your money goes. Is someone clocking in for more than she/he was scheduled? Is someone consistently clocking in for less than she/he was scheduled? Detect all such cases easily by using our “Scheduled vs Actual Hours Worked” report.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Add and Edit Time Clock Entries</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-add-a-new-time-clock-entry-and-edit-the-existing-one/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-05T11:49:27-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-add-a-new-time-clock-entry-and-edit-the-existing-one</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An automated tracking system for employees’ time clock entries is what almost any company needs these days. Why? Because you can set everything up, let your employees clock in and out, then simply process entries for the payroll report through an automated time clock calculator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Clock Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our engineers designed a separate page for the process of manual time clock entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Add-Clock-Time.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Add-Clock-Time.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Add Clock Time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add New Entry via Timesheet Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option for easily adding a new time sheet entry is using the Timesheet page. In the bottom left corner of that page you’ll notice a button labeled as “Add New Entry”. When you click on it, a new row will appear on the page allowing you to fill out those fields and add an entry for one of your employees. When you fill in an employee’s name, the data and time of his time clock entry and select the position, you can save everything by clicking the “Save” button on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing Time Clock Entries via Timesheet Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite similar to the procedure described above, you can easily edit any of your employees’ existing time clock entries. You just need to find the right entry you want to alter, and once you do that, click on the “pencil” icon on the right which will allow you to edit those in-line fields of the specific time sheet entry. You’ll be able to edit a start date, a start time, an end date, an end time, the note, the position and, optionally, a job code in case that option is enabled on your end. As soon as you finish editing, you can simply click on the “Save” icon on the right, and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Exporting Schedules to Different File Formats</title>
   <link href="/blog/schedule-export-to-different-file-formats/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-04T19:45:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/schedule-export-to-different-file-formats</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Besides creating schedules for their employees, managers and company owners frequently need their data exported for the third party processing. Whether such an action is required for an internal company process, or to simply print out or manually make some changes, our schedule maker offers a couple of ways to export any schedule to a desired file format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;_**You can easily export your employees’ schedule for the whole location by using the “Export” option above the schedule.**_&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you click on it, you’ll get a few file types to choose from, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• PDF&lt;/strong&gt;
** • CSV**
** • Excel**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PDF file format can be opened via Adobe Acrobat Reader. In case you do not have it installed on your computer, you can get it for free from Adobe’s website. This export file displays a list of employees on the left hand side with assigned shifts next to each of your employees’ names. To give you a better idea of how a PDF export file may look like, here is a screenshot of an export file from one of our demo accounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Schedule-Export-PDF.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Schedule-Export-PDF-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Schedule Export to PDF&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;csv&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CSV stands for a Comma Separated Values file and it is basically a plain textual file with a set of comma separated values, as its name already suggests. By default, you may see a CSV file on your computer being open by your Microsoft Excel, and the file may look almost the same as an Excel file, although in reality that’s just a text file that you can even edit by using Notepad. Here’s an example of columns and data included in this CSV export file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Schedule-Export-CSV.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Schedule-Export-CSV-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Schedule Export to CSV&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;excel&quot;&gt;Excel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Excel export file, as its name suggests, allows you to have your schedule exported from the system in the Microsoft Excel’s specific file format. As with any other excel file, you’ll get a set of data separated across different columns and cells. To give you a better idea of how our excel export file may look and what kind of data is included, please take a look at the screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Schedule-Export-Excel.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Schedule-Export-Excel-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Schedule Export to Excel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tracking Weekly Staff Costs with NimbleSchedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/weekly-staff-costs/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-03T19:39:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/weekly-staff-costs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule provides an easy to use, yet powerful scheduling and time clocking system. Over time, we’ve added a lot of useful reports to our workforce software covering different areas based on the data available in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**Since our shift planning system had been initially designed to track employees&#39; pay rate info and to store scheduled hours for all employees, it was a logical step to develop an easy to interpret overview that would help administrators and managers stay on top of all scheduled costs.**&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you register with NimbleSchedule and start adding your employees along with their positions and hourly pay rates, all the data needed to calculate your staffing costs will be in our workforce software. If you’d like to have an intuitive insight into staffing costs, you can simply navigate to the Settings section, click on the Schedules option there, and enable the “Show labor cost” option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you save that page, two things will happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; On the Dashboard page you’ll notice a new chart showing up each time you visit this page. It will show you a global cost of all employees across all locations you have in the system. The chart can be switched between different date ranges, and will show a daily, weekly or monthly cost segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Staffing-Cost-Chart.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Staffing-Cost-Chart-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Staffing Costs Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; An additional line will show up on the “Everyone’s schedule” page in the Schedules section below your schedule. Apart from viewing just the number of scheduled hours, you will also be able to view the scheduled cost for each day or simply for the whole week. Since our shift planning system allows location-based scheduling, you will also be able to see the cost for each day, or a full week, for each location by navigating through the location drop down menu in the top right corner of that very page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Weekly-Staff-Cost.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Weekly-Staff-Cost-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Weekly Staff Cost&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The weekly staff cost line will provide insight into your staffing costs for each day and each location based on your schedule. There is no need for you to navigate from the schedule page to one of the reports in the system. Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Exporting Payroll Reports from NimbleSchedule to ADP</title>
   <link href="/blog/exporting-payroll-reports-to-adp/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-01T05:49:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/exporting-payroll-reports-to-adp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nimble Software Systems Inc. is very pleased to announce its latest integration release and addition of ADP to the supported list of payroll systems. With this addition, all customers can configure the system to export payroll reports in the ADP format, which is basically a CSV file that can be easily imported into ADP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, our team made this process super easy and simple to use. The first step includes the configuration of this feature. All you need to enter is your Company code received from ADP and you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ADPConfig.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ADPConfig-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Configuring ADP for Payroll export&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have configured this new feature, you can easily export your payroll report. Then, you can navigate to Reports section and Payroll report page. There you can select all the needed fields and optional parameters and run a detailed payroll report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ADPRunPayrollReport.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ADPRunPayrollReport-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule Payroll Report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you generate a detailed payroll report, you will notice the “Export to ADP” button in the top right corner above the report. If you click it, the system will prompt you to save this export file. Choose an appropriate location on your hard drive to save this file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ADPExport.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ADPExport-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exporting ADP Payroll File&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that exported file you are ready to login to the ADP system and import your payroll report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team continues with development of new features and integrations with other third party systems. Our goal remains to provide our customers with an easy to use and cost effective system for employee management with more HR and Payroll systems integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned and stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule's "Copy To Next Week" Feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/copy-to-next-week/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-28T19:20:17-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/copy-to-next-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To make the scheduling process much easier, our engineers developed a “&lt;strong&gt;Copy To Next Week&lt;/strong&gt;” feature designed to help managers and schedulers create, copy or manipulate shift schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your shifts frequently start and end at different times for different sets of employees, creating some kind of a weekly schedule template that would repeat or copy the same set of shifts can come in handy. Similarly, when a company has a pretty similar work schedule which repeats from week to week, then having some easy to use functionality that will allow schedule syncs from one week to another would be extremely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Schedule-Generator-CopyToNextWeek.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Schedule-Generator-CopyToNextWeek-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Generator - Copy To Next Week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;_**A note of caution: When copying a schedule from one week to another, any existing schedule in the week where you are copying over the new schedule will be replaced with the new schedule. **_&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to save some of those existing shifts, then we strongly advise you to either save those shifts as a &lt;strong&gt;weekly schedule template&lt;/strong&gt; so that you could re-apply them later on when you copy the schedule from the previous week, or to try to remember which shifts you need to re-create later on, in case you are dealing with just a couple of shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Deal With Lazy Co-Workers</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-deal-with-lazy-co-workers/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-27T12:35:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-deal-with-lazy-co-workers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you ever had a chance to work with a colleague that would spend hours online shopping or chatting on Facebook instead of performing assigned daily tasks, then you are probably aware of the situations and frustrations this kind of work ethics may cause. Such behavior at work can affect your work as well if you, as a conscientious worker, start picking up the work duties they missed to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, keeping everything for yourself and letting your frustrations grow with such an unprofessional behavior can cause you to burst into anger or to react inappropriately in certain situations. Therefore, dealing with a lazy co-worker in a proper way is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How-to-deal-with-lazy-co-workers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How-to-deal-with-lazy-co-workers.png&quot; alt=&quot;How to Deal With Lazy Coworkers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give them the benefit of a doubt.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep in mind that the person that seems lazy to you because he is not finishing his work on time may be dealing with some serious private issues. Sometimes work duties or deadlines may not even be so clear, especially if we are talking about new or inexperienced employees. With that being said, it would be unfair to treat that person as a lazy worker or to spread such an opinion to your manager or colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t let their laziness affect your productivity.&lt;/strong&gt; Often times it is very easy to fall into a trap and follow their example of chit chatting during working hours or doing some things that do not necessarily have much to do with work. In case you co-workers are bored and they try to distract you from doing your work, do not hesitate to tell them that you are busy and that you have deadlines to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not cover for a lazy co-worker by taking over parts of his work duties.&lt;/strong&gt; By picking up on work when someone starts slacking, you are actually encouraging his behavior. If you decide not to go to your manager or boss to complain about such behavior, the best way of dealing with a lazy co-worker would actually be to leave to supervisors to notice that a particular employee is slacking and not doing his job as good as he should. So don’t help him by doing part of his duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess the impact of their lazy work attitude towards your personal work.&lt;/strong&gt; Is their behavior directly affecting you or your work in any way? If that is the case, then you might need to do something about it. If their bad work attitude is not affecting you in any way, then perhaps you should not be the one pointing your finger to others and discussing what is fair and what is not. The manager might already be aware of it and may be taking some steps to resolve such a situation. You do not have to be necessarily aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confront your co-worker with his work-related behavior.&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on his work attitude, he might not even care about your words; nevertheless, try to confront him with unbeatable arguments. Do not let that person drag you into a confrontation - just state your arguments and see his reaction. If he attempts to argue with you about it, then that person might not be worth your time and nerves. Remember that if you fall into that trap and start arguing at your work place, you might be considered equally guilty for unprofessional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the matter to your manager.&lt;/strong&gt; Before doing so, try to assess your manager’s reaction. If you believe you may leave an impression of an apple polisher, then perhaps it would be a better idea to wait for an appropriate occasion and, in the meantime, collect more arguments. Speak up about those issues, and let the manager take care of things, having more resources and skills when it comes to dealing with a lazy co-worker.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule User Roles – Access and Privileges</title>
   <link href="/blog/user-roles-access-and-privileges/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-27T11:08:06-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/user-roles-access-and-privileges</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;**In an ideal world you would have a chance to manipulate each part of any software and specify who can access it, how, from which device, etc.**

In reality, since that’s a bit hard to achieve, NimbleSchedule designed different work schedule roles that can be easily assigned to specific users in our employee scheduling system with a set of pre-defined privileges for each role. At the moment, we have 4 different user roles:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Employee&lt;/strong&gt;
** • Scheduler**
** • Manager**
** • Admin**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Four-work-schedule-roles.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Four-work-schedule-roles-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Four Work Schedule Roles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee User Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a default user role for each user being added to the system. It comes with a set of pre-defined schedule maker access rules and privileges and is basically designed for majority of your employees. A user set as an “Employee” will have read-only access to almost all the features in the system. In other words, an employee can view his/her own personal schedule and clock in and out when needed. All other options for the “Employee” user role are optional, and could be enabled or disabled. As an example, you can choose whether or not you want your employees to be able to view everyone’s schedule, to view their personal time sheets, to send private messages to other users in the system or to be able to change any setting on their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduler User Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, the “Scheduler” is allowed to manage the scheduling system for the location where he/she is assigned. This is a slightly more advanced role than the “Employee” role and, besides all the other standard features that any employee has in the system, the main feature of this user role is the schedule management. The “Scheduler” will not have access to the requests section or other user profiles. In case you prefer to keep your employee pay rates hidden from the eyes of the person creating the schedule, you are safe with us. The “Scheduler” does not have access to such data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manager User Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, you can easily set your managers on per-location basis. Once you set a user as a “Manager”, he/she will have a quite high privilege level. Apart from the schedule management, a manager can also approve various requests coming from employees, approve or edit time clock records, run various reports, edit employees’ profiles and many other useful things. The “Manager” will always be restricted to actions that affect only the assigned location as well as to those employees from his/her location. The “Manager” will not have access to any other employee data or requests beyond the location (or locations) where he/she is assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admin User Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to describe the admin role is to say that an “Admin” has access to everything. Plain and simple, an admin can use all the features in NimbleSchedule without any restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Auto Fill Scheduling Functionality from NimbleSchedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/auto-fill-scheduling-functionality/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-26T19:21:04-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/auto-fill-scheduling-functionality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every manager that creates a weekly work schedule has probably been faced with complaints about why some shift was assigned to a certain employee and not to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid such situations, managers often times seek automated tools that would simply randomize a shift creation without human interference.This way, everyone gets an equal chance at a certain shift and total work hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule’s answer to this is our ”Auto Fill” functionality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Schedule-Auto-Fill.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Schedule-Auto-Fill-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule Generator - Auto Fill&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**If you have decided to create all your available work shifts as open shifts instead of manually assigning them to your employee profiles, then you will find the “Auto Fill” functionality very useful. It easily automates the scheduling process and randomly assigns pre-created open shifts to available employees.**&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system will follow all the rules you have set for your employees. For example, if you set so, a shift will be assigned only the employees with an appropriate position on their profiles and with open availability. In case an employee is not available for a specific time or perhaps he already reached his daily or weekly hourly limit, the system will simply ignore and skip this employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also utilize the “Auto Fill” option to simply speed up your scheduling process. If you need to create some order in the shift filling process, you can alternatively setup an employee ranking for all your employees and attach those rankings to your employee positions on their profiles. Once you enable “Use employee ranking while filling open shifts” in the Settings – Schedule section, your employees with higher rankings will be assigned with shifts first whereas the leftovers will be assigned to employees with lower ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that an employee ranking can be configured through the Settings – Employee section. So, the higher the rank an employee has, the higher the chance a shift will be assigned to him during the “Auto Fill” process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Burnout Syndrome</title>
   <link href="/blog/the-burnout-syndrome/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-25T10:29:12-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/the-burnout-syndrome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The burnout syndrome appears to be getting more media attention these days as more and more people have started complaining about it. In the times of economic crisis or instability people tend to focus solely on their work and their professional careers at the same time neglecting their private lives. As a result, they start experiencing burnout syndrome symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burnout can cause a lot of consequences in your personal life as well as in your job performance. The important thing is to know how to recognize some of the burnout syndrome symptoms and take appropriate measures before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of the most common symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Reduced work performance
• Physical and emotional exhaustion
• Lack of motivation
• Reduced concentration or attention ability
• Insomnia and anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some of the symptoms are similar to depression, psychologists make a clear distinction between these two states. While depression permeates all areas of your life, burnout mostly affects your work and your job related duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/burnout-syndrome.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Are-you-burned-out.png&quot; alt=&quot;How To Treat The Burnout Syndrome&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in the burnout syndrome treatment is to recognize its exact source. If the stress you are experiencing over an extensive period of time is coming from too many work related obligations, you should try talking with your manager or HR about it. There are many steps they can take, so an open and honest conversation might really help. If they do not show enough interest to help you cope with that issue, perhaps it is time to move on and start polishing your resume and look for another job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you notice there is room for improvements regarding the ways you handle work or certain tasks, then there are many things you could do to reduce the burnout syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Try to dedicate some of your time to off-work activities, no matter if those include visiting sport events or just good old hanging out with friends for coffee or dinner. Reading a book or going for a walk might also be of help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Organize your work life in a more efficient way. Use the technology and available mobile gadgets to your benefits so that you could save your precious time Time Management Techniques. If you have a manager or a team leading role in your company, then learning and improving on your work delegating techniques may be of a great benefit to reduce the stress on your end Delegating – When, How &amp;amp; to Whom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Get a good night’s sleep. Try to organize your sleeping session and let them be no less than 6-7 hours each day. If needed, switch off your cell phone or any other electronic distractions. Remember that good sleep can improve your overall emotional condition apart from having your body physically recharged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Leave your work in the office. Learn how to dedicate more time to your family and friends. Stay off your phones during the dinner and while playing with your children. If you really must check your emails or voice mails, then try to schedule 30-45 minutes for that purpose somewhere after dinner time. If you have kids, then let that be a practice after setting your kids to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of these burnout syndrome treatment methods helps, or at least doesn’t help enough, then seeking some professional help might be the best idea. As mentioned earlier, if your current job is consuming too much of your life and you can’t seem to cope with it, then taking a short vacation to recharge your batteries or even looking for another job may be the only solution.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Integrate NimbleSchedule with LightSpeed</title>
   <link href="/blog/lightspeed-integration/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-24T05:58:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/lightspeed-integration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule is happy to announce the integration with LightSpeed, the Montreal based software company. This great retail and POS system provides cutting-edge solutions to all kind of businesses, with the main focus being on restaurants and retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect your LightSpeed account with NimbleSchedule, please navigate to the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the panel and select “Applications”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed1Applications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed1Applications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Configuring LightSpeed integration - Step 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the list of the available partner integrations please click on “LightSpeed”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed2Applications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed2Applications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Configuring LightSpeed integration - Step 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be directed to LightSpeed’s system where you can enter your login information and confirm this new integration. Once you do that, you will be taken back to your NimbleSchedule account in order to configure some additional fields you would like to synchronize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed3Applications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed3Applications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Configuring LightSpeed integration - Step 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the screenshot, you can select to import your sales information from LightSpeed to NimbleSchedule and you can choose whether you want to import time clock data or export time clock data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you decide to import sales information from LightSpeed, your chart on the dashboard will start including your sales information vs your staffing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SalesChart.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SalesChart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Import time clock entries from LightSpeed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you decide to enable importing of time clock entries or exporting of time clock entries from NimbleSchedule to LightSpeed, you will notice an additional option appearing on your Timesheets page, which you can use to import or export time clock data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed1Timesheets.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LightSpeed1Timesheets-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Import time clock entries from LightSpeed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule will automatically flag all the entries you have already exported to LightSpeed and it will warn you if you try to export duplicate entries. Note that in order for the export to work, your location name in NimbleSchedule must match your shop/store name in LightSpeed. For the time being, you can choose to import entries to export them to LightSpeed, so these options exclude each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling Rules and Limits</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-rules-and-limits/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-21T18:06:01-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-rules-and-limits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managers spend lots of hours trying to satisfy employee scheduling requests. When managing a large team of professionals, this process can turn into a full day of juggling requests, leaving little time to your own job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule aims to relieve some of this unnecessary wasted time by providing tools for improving efficiency of employee scheduling. The procedure is very simple and straightforward. Namely, when you login to our schedule maker, navigate your employees’ list and click on a specific employee’s name. By doing so, you can see his/her full profile. Among other things, on the left hand side, you’ll notice a small sub-menu that allows you to configure certain things just for the employee you are currently reviewing. One of those options is labeled as “Scheduling”. As soon as you click on that option, you’ll get to see a new page with additional options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Employee-Scheduling-Rules.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Employee-Scheduling-Rules-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Maker - Employee Rules &amp;amp; Limits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section allows you to cap certain limits on an individual employee basis. These options include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Maximum hours per week&lt;/strong&gt;
** • Maximum hours per day**
** • Maximum days per week**
** • Maximum shifts per day**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four options allow you to set specific scheduling rules for each of your employees. By using these options you can easily set your employee to a limit of 30 hours per week, if needed, or 6 hours per day and make sure that all other managers and web schedulers in your company schedule your employees according to those rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you or some of your managers try to schedule an employee that will push him over his configured limits, the system will automatically warn you. Of course, if you decide to proceed and override the warning, the system will let you proceed, but you will be clearly warned that your employee is about to cross the configured limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not need all those limits set, you can simply choose the ones you want to use and fill them out while leaving all other fields empty. Since that’s a setting on an employee basis, then you can quite easily configure completely different rules and limits for different employees.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easy Account Setup with NimbleSchedule's Intro Wizard</title>
   <link href="/blog/shift-planning-account-setup-wizard/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-14T09:27:29-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/shift-planning-account-setup-wizard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting started with any kind of software usually represents a challenge to a new user, no matter how much experience that user has with computer/internet usage in general. Familiarizing with some of the features and functionalities of newly obtained software could sometimes take a lot of time and patience. This is why our experts and engineers have created an intro setup wizard that will help you configure some of the basic steps for the use of our shift planning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you will see once you register with NimbleSchedule and confirm your email address is the intro tutorial video which will give you a quick overview of some of the basic functionalities of our cloud schedule builder. When you finish watching the video, you’ll get to our setup wizard. There are 5 steps covered in this wizard and by completing those steps you will have some of the basic stuff ready to start using our web scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1--departments&quot;&gt;Step 1 – Departments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Planning Setup Wizard - Step 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this first step of our setup wizard you will get just one question to answer with Yes or No, and you will have a choice to select whether or not you wish to group your employees per department or not. In case you are not sure, you can always change your answer through the software later on, so don’t worry if you decide just to skip that step and proceed to the next one. If you decide to answer with a “Yes”, then you will be presented with an option to create your departments at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2--positions&quot;&gt;Step 2 – Positions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Builder Setup Wizard - Step 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once you get to the second step of our intro setup wizard, you will have a chance to create positions needed for your employees, which you will be able to assign to employee profiles later on. Again, in case you do not have the full list already prepared, you can start by adding just a couple of positions to get you started and afterwards you will be able to add more positions or make any changes to the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3--locations&quot;&gt;Step 3 – Locations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step3-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Web Scheduler Setup Wizard - Step 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The third step of our setup wizard will allow you to configure a couple of things:
&lt;strong&gt;• Timezone – You will be able to configure your default timezone for your company as well as for your personal user profile through this field. In case you have employees across multiple timezones, don’t worry - they will have a chance to configure their own timezone setting later on through their profiles.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Location name – By default our system will simply create a location name for your employees by using your company name and adding the “HQ” at the end. Optionally, you can rename this default location and name it the way you wish.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;• Additional locations – The last section on this page will allow you to create additional locations for your company account. In case all your employees work in a single location or you simply do not need to use multiple locations, then you can leave those fields empty and you’ll get to use just your default location.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4--employees&quot;&gt;Step 4 – Employees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Setup-Wizard-Step4-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Builder Setup Wizard - Step 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this last step of our setup wizard, you’ll have a chance to enter your employee names and assign positions to their profiles. If you have such data in an excel or a CSV file, then you can simply use the “Choose file” button and import your employee list. Once you have either manually entered your employee names or imported your employee list, you can click on “I’m done” to exit the wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mobile Workforce Scheduling System</title>
   <link href="/blog/mobile-workforce-scheduling-system/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-07T09:40:57-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/mobile-workforce-scheduling-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being a powerful and feature-rich workforce management tool, NimbleSchedule allows managers and their employees to use their smart phones both to create and check schedules. The only thing needed is an Android phone or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure is quite simple and straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the Google Play Store or App Market and look for the term “NimbleSchedule”. Once you find our app, install it as you would install any other application on your phone and you are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nimbleschedule.android.client&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/themes/nimble/images/btn_gplay.png&quot; alt=&quot;Android Phone Schedule Creator&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nimbleschedule/id651708471?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/themes/nimble/images/btn_appstore.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone Work Schedule App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When you have our app installed, simply run it and enter your username and password for your NimbleSchedule account. You will be required to enter your login information only once. Every next time, the app should log you in automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you login to the app, the first screen you will see is the schedule view. In case you are an employee and your company restricts employees from viewing everyone’s work schedule, then you will have an option to view your personal schedule as well as open shifts available for pick-up. If you are a manager or an administrator, apart from viewing the work schedule, you will also have an option to create a schedule on the fly by using your phone along with our app. Furthermore, you will also be able to view certain requests submitted by your employees and you’ll have a chance to approve them or to reject them. No more waiting to get to the office, since you can do most of the stuff while traveling to work or waiting for a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are an employee and your company permits the use of the smart phone apps for time &amp;amp; attendance, then you’ll have a chance to clock in and out by using your phone. The time of having to walk to some dedicated clock post just to clock in or out for your shift has gone. You can do that by using the device you already use every day - your mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NimbleSchedule-Mobile-Shift-Planning.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NimbleSchedule-Mobile-Shift-Planning-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Planning Web Scheduler&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you as a manager or administrator allow your employees clock in and out from their smart phones, you will have an additional piece of info on their timesheet entries along with a date, time, note and position. When using a smart phone app for time and attendance, your employees will also leave a GPS stamp when they clock in and out. Therefore, while reviewing your employees’ timesheets, you’ll have a chance to see the exact location from which your workforce members clocked in for work. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay on top of your scheduling and workforce management needs by using NimbleSchedule smart phone apps for iPhone and Android. Our engineers and developers are working hard on adding even more powerful features to our app, so stay tuned for more info!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Save Time on Re-occurring Schedules with Templates</title>
   <link href="/blog/work-schedule-templates/"/>
   <updated>2015-06-04T10:50:26-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/work-schedule-templates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Re-creating the same set of shifts from week to week is certainly no fun for any manager or supervisor. Particularly if they manage a larger team of employees, this process could waste so many hours of their precious time. This is why our experts invested their time and effort to find easy ways for creating repetitive work schedules. One of those solutions provided by our employee scheduling software is Schedule Template management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Work-Schedule-Template.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Work-Schedule-Template-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Web Scheduler - Schedule Templates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A schedule template, plain and simple, is a saved schedule for your team on a certain location for a specific period of time. You can save a schedule as a template for just one day, a couple of days, a week, or a full month. The choice is yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Save-Work-Schedule-Template.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Maker - Save as Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you name your schedule template the way you like and select a date range, you can choose whether you want to save all those shifts with or without your employees’ names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving the template with employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option will simply allow you to save the schedule as you see it. All your shifts will stay assigned to the same employees on the template as well. Once you decide to re-apply the template, the same employees will be automatically assigned with the same set of shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving the template without employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you want to save all the shifts you have on the schedule, but you think those shifts may be assigned to different employees, then you can use this option. This functionality allows you to save time on creating repetitive shifts that do not necessarily need to be assigned to the same employees in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as you save the template, you will see it in the “Schedule template” section in the sub-menu. You can click on your template, and edit it on the fly. So, the next time when you re-apply your template, all the changes you have made will be applied as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Apply-Work-Schedule-Template.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule Maker - Apply Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying a schedule template is even easier than saving it. You just find the week when you wish to re-apply your template, click on the Tools above the schedule and select “Apply template” from the list of options. There, you simply select your template, optionally re-adjust the date range when you wish to start applying your template and click the “Apply” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforce availability and schedule limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you would like the system to follow your employees’ availability set that perhaps changed in the meantime between creating the template and applying it, you can enable “Enforce availability and schedule limits”, which will simply send all those shifts that were supposed to be applied to certain employees who are no longer available to the Open Shifts area.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easy and Effective Communication Tools</title>

   <updated>2015-05-30T10:41:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/easy-and-effective-communication-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having an easy to use and effective communication tools to broadcast your messages to your employees or get important info from your workforce or managers is an important piece of puzzle when running a successful business. Aside from the announcements functionality, NimbleSchedule also offers a direct messaging tool that allows you to send a private message to just one employee or to group of employees thus increasing overall employee engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways would be to click on the “Send message” link in the bottom right corner of any page in NimbleSchedule’s panel. Apart from that option, you can also click on the “Inbox” link in the top right corner of the page and then simply click on the “New Message” button. By clicking on any of these 2 options, you will be prompted to a new popup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Corporate-Communications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Corporate-Communications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Effective Corporate Communications&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get to this popup dialog, you’ll have an option to select whether you wish to send your message to a specific group of users in the system or to select a specific person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group option allows you to select a specific department or a position as the recipient. This means that all employees with the selected position or department on their profile would receive such a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through such a functionality department managers or administrators can easily communicate with just certain employees working in a selected department or a position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If needed, you can also select the “Specific people” option instead of the “Groups” and simply select one or more employees that you wish to receive your message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this process is very straightforward. Besides the subject of the message, you can just fill in the message body, and simply click “Send”. Once you have dispatched this message, your employees get notified instantly. Of course, depending on their notification preferences, your employees may or may not be notified about this direct message via email or SMS as well. In case some of your employees have chosen not to be notified via email or SMS, then a new private message will be clearly visible as soon as they login to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides reading your message, your employees can respond to it, either via email directly or by logging in to NimbleSchedule and responding through our easy to use interface.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>QR Code Scanner – Time Clock Tablet App</title>
   <link href="/blog/qr-code-scanner-time-clock-tablet-app/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-24T10:15:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/qr-code-scanner-time-clock-tablet-app</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Frequently business owners reach out to us seeking alternatives to regular clocking in methods due to their company’s diverse requirements. Most of our competitors cover just the basics, but when it comes to flexibility regarding time clock methods, then that’s where our time clock software is unbeatable. Aside from the regular clock in methods (via computer or smart phone), we also allow business owners to activate additional options like time clock via SMS, phone call, QR code scanner and biometric devices. In this article, we’ll cover the QR Code Scan – Time Clock Tablet App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namely, our engineers designed a very easy to use and simple Time Clock app for tablets, both Android and iPad. More specifically, you can use your web-enabled portable device and mount it somewhere on the wall or on a desk in your company and make it a clock post for your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a time clock tablet for this purpose is pretty simple as long as you have everything connected. You just install and run our Time Clock app from either the Google Play market or the iTunes store and you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblesoftware.qrreader&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/themes/nimble/images/btn_gplay.png&quot; alt=&quot;QR Code Time Clock Tablet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nimbleschedule-timeclock/id881647541?mt=8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/themes/nimble/images/btn_appstore.png&quot; alt=&quot;QR Code Time Clock iPad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you run the Time Clock app on your Android tablet or iPad, you can simply have your employee approach the device, flash his QR Code in front of the camera and our time clock software will automatically log him in. Next, the only thing an employee needs to do is to click the big button in the middle of the screen with the label “Clock-in” and that’s it. The process is automatically completed and logged out, so the next employee is ready to flash his QR Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/TimeClockApp1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/TimeClockApp1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Clock Software - Clock in&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/TimeClockApp2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/TimeClockApp2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Clock Software - Clock out&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your preferences, you can either have those QR codes printed out for your employees on check-in code cards, or simply have them use their smart phone and flash the screen from our regular NimbleSchedule app with a QR Code generated. If you’d prefer to print those codes out, then you can login to your NimbleSchedule account and navigate to the Reports section. Once there, click on the “Employees” option in the sub-menu and then choose the “QR Codes” option in the drop down, and click the “Filter” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/QR-Code-Generator.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/QR-Code-Generator-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;QR Code Generator - Time Clock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our engineers continue to work on designing new options and methods that will ensure even greater flexibility frequently needed due to various types of businesses using our time clock software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, stay tuned and stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Workforce Availability Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/workforce-availability-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-23T08:58:07-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/workforce-availability-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our cloud workforce scheduling platform offers multiple ways to set your employee scheduling availability. Besides the regular time-off requesting system, our software also features two additional types of employee availabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Weekly repeating availability
• One time/Future availability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can enable or disable any of these options though the settings section. Under the “Time-Off &amp;amp; Availability” settings section, you’ll notice two options that allow you to enable/disable weekly availability as well as to enable/disable future availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Workforce-Availability-Settings.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Workforce-Availability-Settings-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling Availability Settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weekly--repeating-availability&quot;&gt;Weekly / Repeating Availability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you enable “Employees can set weekly availability” in the settings section, all your employees will have the option “Availability Preferences” under their profiles. As an administrator or a manager, you can also access their availability preferences page through their profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Workforce-Availability-Preferences.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Workforce-Availability-Preferences-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Workforce Schedule Weekly Availability&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this page, each of your employees can set the repeating availability that will simply repeat every week. In case your employees need to set themselves as not available on every Monday or Tuesday, for example, then they can simply do that through this page by setting the weekly availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to block out certain days or time slots. The easiest way is to click on the day and time when you wish your unavailability to start and then drag your mouse across the row to mark the part of the day on your profile as unavailable. Another, again very simple method is to click on the day and time when you want your unavailability to start and release the mouse. A small popup will show with the start time already prefilled and you can simply enter the time by which you want your unavailability to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-availability&quot;&gt;Future Availability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where setting the weekly availability just doesn’t work, there is our so called “future availability” which can be set through the “My Schedule” page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Employee-Future-Availability.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Employee-Future-Availability-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling Future Availability&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting this one-time availability is pretty easy as well. All you need to do is navigate to the right week, click on the day/time when you wish to start your un-availability and simply select the end time. Optionally, you can define a reason and leave a note on why you are not available on that specific day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if needed, you could repeat such future availability for a specific number of times using different repeat patterns our system provides. With this option, you achieve a similar functionality to the weekly availability, the only difference being that with this particular option you are setting your unavailability for a certain number of pre-selected days whereas the weekly availability will repeat indefinitely until terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Business Branding Techniques</title>
   <link href="/blog/business-branding-techniques/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-23T00:01:42-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/business-branding-techniques</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s a competitive market out there no matter what type of industry your company is in. Succeeding in business, especially if you are an entrepreneur with a new product or service to offer can be a challenge. Hence, if you wish to stay in business for years, there are certain do’s and don’ts to follow. One of those really important aspects of any type of business is brand management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An effective branding strategy can give you an edge over your competitors. A word of caution is that even the best possible branding cannot repair the damage of a faulty service or a product. With that thought in mind, you definitely need to ensure that your products or services are at the best possible level before investing too much time in your company brand. Once you are sure that those aspects are at the highest level, you can proceed to brand your business and compete with your business opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, sure, you are not the owner or manager of Coca Cola or Apple, but what is preventing you from having an equally, if not even better, designed logo for your business? Having a great logo is part of that branding strategy that could mean the difference between succeeding or failing on the market. Investing some time and money in designing the best possible logo that you’ll be proudly sticking on any means of communication with your clients, including your website, store front, product packaging, restaurant menu, or any other promotional material you decide to share with the world is a wise idea. Make sure your logo looks good both in large and small resolutions because you will need it for various uses. Therefore, designing a logo that has too much going on may not be the best idea for scenarios where you do not have enough room to print out a large version of your logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your company logo, as well as any other aspect of your business should follow the same style. Consistency is extremely important when it comes to branding. No matter if you are about to design a website, flyer, restaurant menu or product packaging, your colors, fonts and the overall styling should remain consistent throughout all these different forms. If you already have a website and you are about to order a business card for you or your managers, then make sure your business card follows the same standards you already established on your website or in your actual store. Use the same logo across those different formats, because in your business battle, your logo is your proud banner. Stick it up and high proudly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding on your brand strategy, make sure you have taken into consideration all your strengths. What makes your company or your product different from your competitors? Is it high quality? Or is it maybe a low price? Depending on your answer to these questions, your strategy may need some adjustment in one direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great part of branding strategy is to develop a tagline that will describe your company or your product in the best possible way with the least possible words used. Repeat such a tagline in all your printable or online materials whenever possible. Having an easily memorable statement as your tagline could mean a lot for you in getting more clients or getting some of your existing clients to do business with your company again. It will simply make you stand out from your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, be true to your brand. If you made some claims and promises in your branding strategy, then make 100% sure you stay true to those promises. There is no worse brand strategy than failing to deliver some of the promises you so boldly pointed out. Make sure you deliver what you promised!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easy to Use Time-Off Request Functionality</title>
   <link href="/blog/easy-to-use-time-off-request-functionality/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-22T10:07:24-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/easy-to-use-time-off-request-functionality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although dealing with various employee requests may sound frustrating and time consuming, with NimbleSchedule, this task is super easy and simple. Namely, through the configuration section you can define on how many days in advance your employees need to submit a specific time-off request. For example, you can set the system not to accept time-off requests if coming for the period of less than 3 days. This gives your time off managers an opportunity to set some basic time-off rules and stay on top of all your coverage needs with no hassle at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Time-Off-Settings.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Time-Off-Settings-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Off Manager Settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have this option enabled, you are all set. When an employee logs in to his panel and goes to the “Requests” section, he will be able to submit a time off request form on his own. Employees can request just one part of the day off, or a full day off. Of course, multiple days in a row can be selected as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Time-Off-Request.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Time-Off-Request-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Vacation Request Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as your employee submits a vacation request form, all the location managers will receive a notification via email and/or SMS. A manager then simply logs into the system, clicks on the “Requests” section and then to “Time-Off” and decides whether or not he wants to approve that new request. Apart from approving or rejecting new requests, all time off managers and administrators will have a chance to review previous time-off requests as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to each request, you’ll see a date range for which your employee is requesting a time off, the date when this time off request form was submitted as well as the stated reason for the request,. Additionally, you will see all the conflicting shifts that will be affected in case you decide to approve that particular time-off. So, even without looking at your employee’s schedule and looking for that specific date range, you’ll get the exact list of the scheduled shifts that will be affected. Neat, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Time-Off-Requests.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Time-Off-Requests-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Off Request Form Approval&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you approve this request, your employee may or may not receive an email or a text message notification, depending on his notification preferences setting. All affected shifts for the days when you approved the time-off for your employee will simply go to the Open Shifts area and you can have other employees apply to pick them up or simply manually re-assign them to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Increase Employee Engagement With NimbleSchedule</title>

   <id>/blog/increase-employee-engagement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule actively involves all your employees in the scheduling process and improves employee relations. By providing your employees with access to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/staff-management-tips/&quot;&gt;workforce management&lt;/a&gt; system, you can allow them to perform certain tasks thus saving you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Engagement-Increase-With-NimbleSchedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Engagement-Increase-With-NimbleSchedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Improve Employee Engagement With NimbleSchedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-trades&quot;&gt;Shift trades&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our modern cloud platform allows your employees to trade shifts with each other without your involvement. Optionally, you can choose whether or not you want your managers and supervisors to have the final saying about those shift trades at the end of the process. By default, all such trade requests will come to the manager for the final approval once two employees agree on swapping their shifts. Of course, only employees with proper positions on their profiles will be able to swap such scheduled shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-replacements&quot;&gt;Shift replacements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our system you can allow your employees to find coverage for the whole or just part of their shift. In case you generally allow your employees to find replacements, they will be able to select one of the available employees with the right position on their profile and ask them to cover for either just one part of their shift or a whole scheduled slot. Once the other side approves that shift replacement request, the manager will be notified about it and he will have the final word about that request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shift-drops&quot;&gt;Shift drops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an employee is not able to work on a specific day or cover a specific shift, he can submit a shift drop request that comes to the manager for an approval. Once the manager or supervisor approves that request,  it goes to the Open Shift area so that other employees with the proper position on their profile could apply and pick it up. Of course, as with all previous options, the shift drop procedure can be enabled or disabled through the settings section, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides those schedule changes, there are other actions you can allow your employees to perform in order to make the scheduling and supervision process easier. You can also allow your employees to submit time-off requests, as well as to set their weekly repeating or one-time availability through the schedule page. All these options make your employees more engaged in the scheduling process which results in saving both time and money on your end as well as for your managers and supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Involving your employees in the scheduling and management process improves workplace morale and team communication and it boosts employee motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Full Screen Mode Functionality</title>
   <link href="/blog/scheduling-software-full-screen-mode/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-14T10:46:09-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/scheduling-software-full-screen-mode</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those managers who frequently creates and plans employee shifts, then you are certainly aware of numerous distractions that could easily lure you away from your work. With this idea in mind, our scheduling software engineers developed a so-called “Full Screen Mode” which allows a scheduler to eliminate any visual distractions and work on the schedule in his full (browser) screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already a NimbleSchedule subscriber but you haven’t used this useful feature, you can easily find it in the top right corner above the schedule. With the current setup, this feature is displayed on all three schedule views: daily, weekly and monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Schedule-Maker-Full-Screen1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Schedule-Maker-Full-Screen1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scheduling Software - Full Screen Mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you click on the “Full Screen Mode” option, you’ll notice that the rest of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/online-schedule-maker-manage-your-staff-work-schedule-easily/&quot;&gt;schedule maker&lt;/a&gt; will simply disappear and the page view will focus on the schedule part only. This allows you to handle the schedule in a larger overview with nothing on the screen but your employees and the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Schedule-Maker-Full-Screen2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Schedule-Maker-Full-Screen2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Work Schedule Maker - Full Screen Mode&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the weekly view, you will notice another very similar option, right next to the “Full Screen Mode”, called the “Quick Edit Mode”. This option gives you almost the same view, but with a slight adjustment for adding new shifts. Instead of displaying a popup for shift creation, you’ll notice that the system provides you with an in-line option to add a new shift. This allows you to enter just a shift time, instead of having to fill in other data and select a position and/or department. In this case, these other details will be selected automatically for you, allowing you to speed up the creation of new shifts for your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as always, the search box will be included in the view in the top left corner, allowing you to filter out just some specific employees. Once you are happy with the schedule, you can simply click on the “Exit full screen mode” button in the top left corner above the schedule and return to the regular system view with all other features presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to see more features like this one, please let us know. We’d love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No matter if you just started your business or you are already an experienced entrepreneur, having easy to read and simple to generate reports could be extremely useful for monitoring your company’s income and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a user of NimbleSchedule, then you’ve probably noticed a lot of powerful reports in our employee engagement system. One of the extremely valuable sections under the “Reports” tab is the “Locations” section. If your schedule is broken down per location, this is the right financial reporting section for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you navigate to the Locations section under the “Reports” tab, you’ll see a breakdown for each of your locations. See the image below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Location-Reports-Intro.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Location-Reports-Intro-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Location Reports - Financial reporting&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in each of our actionable reports, you will also see a filter with a couple of options on top of this page. This specific one allows you to filter only a specific location and/or refine a specific date range. Below, you’ll see a list of your locations along with a couple of columns showing very useful data for your cost monitoring. You’ll see a number of scheduled employees for each location, the number of scheduled hours and the cost for those hours based on your employee pay-rates set in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see a more detailed breakdown, you can simply click on the location name in the first column, and a new page will show up. On top of this page you’ll see a small chart, a summary report and a detailed breakdown per department and position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Location-Reports-Detailed.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Location-Reports-Detailed-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Location Reports - Staffing costs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the place where you can see a number of scheduled employees per each department, the number of scheduled hours as well as the scheduled cost. You can simply click on the department name in the first column and either collapse the data into a department summary or see a full breakdown per position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart  from this breakdown per various parameters, you’ll also see a total at the bottom of the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all other reports in NimbleSchedule, you can export this report to a CSV file and use the data in some external software or adjust it for a specific printable report.&lt;/p&gt;

   <link href="/blog/payroll-partner-integrations/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-10T10:54:30-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/payroll-partner-integrations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apart from utilizing our simple and easy to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/payroll-reports-made-easy/&quot;&gt;payroll reporting&lt;/a&gt; system, you can optionally decide to use some external payroll provider along with our system. If you already have a payroll provider or you plan on using one, you can easily choose one of the providers that integrate with our system. By using these online payroll systems, you can minimize the time needed for data input and have everything synced within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Payroll-Partners.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Payroll-Partners-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Partner Payroll Integrations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;zenpayroll&quot;&gt;ZenPayroll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our development team designed an API integration with ZenPayroll that works flawlessly. Connecting both systems requires two steps at the beginning, but once you have everything configured properly, you can run a payroll report on our end and export it to ZenPayroll with one click of a button. There is no need to spend hours on your employee payroll completion when everything can be done within seconds. If you are new to NimbleSchedule, then simply click on the “My Account” link in the top right corner of the panel, then click on “Applications” on that page and select the “ZenPayroll” icon. The system will take you to ZenPayroll to login and confirm this synchronization. Once you have done that, the list of all available employees from ZenPayroll will appear in your integration part of the panel with NimbleSchedule and you can link your employee profiles on both ends. Later on, while running a payroll report in NimbleSchedule, you can simply choose “Export to Zenpayroll”. It’s that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quickbooks-online&quot;&gt;QuickBooks Online&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you use for your payroll needs one of the most popular account software in the world, QuickBooks Online, then the  great news is that you can easily export the time clock data from NimbleSchedule into Quickbooks Online. All you need to do is to connect your NimbleSchedule account with your Quickbooks Online account by navigating to the My Account section and then to the “Applications” page and from there simply slick on the “Connect” icon next to the QuickBooks logo. Once you have everything synchronized, you can easily export your employee time clock records from the Timesheet page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adp&quot;&gt;ADP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADP is another big name in the payroll industry for which we developed a certain level of integration. Unlike with the ones previously mentioned, our integration with the ADP system allows you to run a payroll export and simply export it to a file adjusted for import into ADP. Hence, if you’d like to use this payroll provider, you can easily configure your NimbleSchedule account for such a task. Simply navigate to the Settings section and select the “Payroll Settings” option there. Instead of a CSV format, please select ADP and once you save all the necessary parameters, save the page. From that moment, each time you run a payroll report, you’ll notice a big button in the top right cover above the payroll report table with the label “Export to ADP”. Once you click on it, you’ll be prompted to save the file on your computer, which you can easily import into ADP at any point later on. If needed, you can also open a file in your Excel or Excel compatible software and edit certain lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of these providers we mentioned above, there are others that integrate with our system from their own end. Due to a highly efficient and stable API system that our engineers and developers designed and implemented, other systems are able to develop a payroll integration with our API protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simplepay&quot;&gt;SimplePay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SimplePay is a modern Canadian payroll provider that handles all aspects of payroll preparation, compliance, e-filing and automated direct deposits. From their end, there is a payroll integration developed that allows you to easily integrate with NimbleSchedule and have your data imported into SimplePay’s system with just a couple of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;traxpayroll&quot;&gt;TRAXPayroll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAXPayroll is another amazing cloud payroll provider that’s been in business for over 17-18 years. Their system allows you to securely manage your payroll 24 hours a day from any computer, smart phone or tablet, with the Internet access. TRAXPayroll’s development team made an effort to integrate with our API system and designed an easy to use process with a couple of easy steps to complete in order to have the data sync between our two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Payroll Reports Made Easy</title>
   <link href="/blog/payroll-reports-made-easy/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-09T10:57:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/payroll-reports-made-easy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule offers a quick and easy to use payroll reporting system based on your employees’ time clock entries. No matter how big or small your company is, it takes seconds to generate a payroll report using our fast and modern employee scheduling and time clock system. Parameters for running a payroll report are easily customizable, which makes our system flexible enough for a variety of demands and industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using no other software than your browser, you can access our online SaaS system and perform all needed operations, including running a payroll report. Here is the explanation of a couple of useful options you can use while running a payroll report for your workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Payroll-Report.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Payroll-Report-thump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Payroll Report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;selecting-a-date-range-for-the-payroll-report&quot;&gt;Selecting a Date Range for the Payroll Report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps you’ll probably do is to select a proper date range for which you wish to run a cloud payroll report. Unlike some less flexible online systems, our software allows you to select any date range you prefer. There are absolutely no restrictions on the pay range or the number of times you can execute a payroll report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;payroll-report-location-filtering&quot;&gt;Payroll Report Location Filtering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our workforce scheduling and time clocking system allows administrators to create an unlimited number of different locations for easier employee management. With that fact in mind, our system allows managers and administrators to filter only specific locations for the payroll report, while leaving out the ones you simply do not wish to cover by the report. By default you will always have all locations selected, so there is nothing here that needs to be done, but if you wish to break down your staffing costs per location, then that’s certainly an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employee-selection&quot;&gt;Employee Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our modern payroll reporting system allows you to run an employee payroll report for a selected group of employees only, if needed. From the list of employees you can easily select an option to include all employees into the report, or you can refine the report by selecting only the desired employees. In case you have just registered with NimbleSchedule, you’ll notice that the list of employees on this page is empty unless your employees already have at least one approved time clock entry. Hence, if you are a new user, always make sure that your employee time clock entries are approved prior to running a payroll report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optional-columns-to-include&quot;&gt;Optional Columns to Include&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the default parameters that will be displayed with each payroll report, our system also offers an option to select additional parameters to include. Those additional parameters are: Employee ID, Job Code, Location, Position, Pay Rate and Shift notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overtime-calculations-and-breaks&quot;&gt;Overtime Calculations and Breaks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most important features of our modern employee management cloud system, you can select a specific rule for overtime calculations when running a cloud payroll report. Those options currently allow you to simply ignore any overtime hours and calculations, or to select a Weekly overtime calculation or California overtime.  Additionally, if you’d like to have your employees’ unpaid breaks deducted from the total number of approved hours when running a payroll report, you can simply select an option to exclude those unpaid breaks on this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;payroll-report-available-in-two-formats&quot;&gt;Payroll Report Available in Two Formats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have selected all available options and fields, you can proceed to running a report. By default, you will be presented with two options which allow you to see a detailed payroll report or a summary report. The detailed report will simply list details for each of your employee time clock records with a total listed for each employee whereas the summary report will simply show the total for each of your employees. Depending on your specific need, you can run any of these two available payroll report types.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mobile Time Clock With GPS Stamping</title>
   <link href="/blog/gps-time-clock/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-08T11:23:58-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/gps-time-clock</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule offers Android and iPhone apps to its respected subscribers without any restrictions or additional costs. By using our smart phone apps, employers can easily monitor their employees’ time and attendance in cases where they do not necessarily come to a single clock location post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Intuitive App Interface For Great Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team of UI experts carefully designed the app’s interface thus ensuring outstanding user experience. An easy navigation through intuitive menu options and simple use of all available functionalities are just some of the values of our app system. Once employees download and install our apps from Google Play Market or iTunes App Market, they can login to the system using their login credentials and start monitoring their schedule, submit requests and clock in and out on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Touch Clocking In and Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When remote time clocking is necessary, employers can easily enable mobile clocking in for their employees. As soon as that option has been enabled, employees can start clocking in and out by using their Android and iPhone. By simply clicking the “Clock-In” button in the middle of the screen through the Time Clock section, an employee can clock in and signalize to our system that his work time has started. Once that has been done, all managers and supervisors will be able to see which employee is currently clocked in, from where and for how long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPS Time Tracking is Automatically Enabled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things even better, our system features GPS time clock stamping of each employee’s clocking entry. This means that employers do not need to make any settings or perform any actions. Our smart phone apps will simply generate GPS coordinates for each employee’s time clock entries, empowering the company administrators and supervisors to easily monitor and track locations used by employees to clock in to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NS-GPS.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NS-GPS-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Tracking - GPS Time Clock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Click to View the Map With GPS Coordinates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as any of employees clock in to the system, supervisors get access to their GPS location by simply clicking on the GPS icon next to each timesheet entry. A popup window will show with a map and the exact location pinpointed on the map from where an employee clocked in for his work time. This piece of information provides a better insight and control over time tracking and boosts overall supervising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Should Your Company Use This Method?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for your employees to perform better, they need to be provided with tools they are comfortable to work with, the ones that are simple and easy enough to use. What better method could be utilized than using their own personal smart phones for such actions. They already know the system they use and they feel extremely comfortable with such a solution. This is why this method has been one of the most popular features our system has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Role of HR Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/role-hr-management/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-06T22:34:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/role-hr-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The role of HR Management in a company is to hire, train and develop employee staff members and nourish good relations as well as a healthy work environment. A well-developed training process enables employees to achieve better work results, reach their full potential and succeed in winning promotions or excelling at certain areas of a company’s work. Apart from having the hiring and training role, HRM is also in charge of planning the future staffing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we will list some of the most important HR management responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HR Management Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruitment&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the primary roles of HR Management in any company. HRM experts usually define job qualifications and experience requirements for new staff members needed for a specific job. According to those predefined criteria, HR managers select the most qualified or experienced applicants and assign them to proper job roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt; is another important role that HR managers usually assume in companies. Whenever needed, it is usually an HR manager that defines on what kind of training should be assigned to a new employee or staff member in order to better their performance in the organizational setting. Such training sessions are usually designed by HRM and focused on the relevant points from the scope of the job position an individual currently holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; is an important factor in every company. It is needed and required on all levels – among employees themselves, managers and/or different teams – in order for them to achieve specific goals or even overall company’s success. The HRM takes care of the healthy and professional relationship on all those levels and makes sure that the company is running in sync at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disputes&lt;/strong&gt; are, unfortunately, inevitable part of business environments, no matter how well employees cooperate on a daily basis. Conflicts and arguments are to be expected, especially in teams that involve higher number of staff members, and that’s where HR management plays another very important role. It is HRM’s responsibility to mediate between the disputing sides, listen to what each member has to say and define the strategy or recommendation of the ways to overcome such unpleasant situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment&lt;/strong&gt; building and enforcing is another aspect usually defined and handled by HRM. Throughout the whole hiring process, HR management is to carefully select candidates with right skills and a proper level of commitment for their new positions. But the story doesn’t stop there. It is an HR manager’s duty to clearly monitor and enforce employees’ commitment to their duties later on, once they assume their role in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; supervision and appraisals are usually also part of the HR management roles in the company. While their direct/department managers and supervisors monitor the quality of their work, HR managers usually monitor overall performance and coordinate actions with their direct supervisors. This process ensures that employees are on the right path in helping the company achieve its goals, but also on the path of achieving personal goals. HR management can provide advice and, if needed, additional trainings to motivate employees in enhancing certain skills and competencies or helping them achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity&lt;/strong&gt; building and monitoring is another area where HR management plays an important role. Different firms have different rules and policies regarding rewarding their employees for good performance and advancement of their skills. It is an HR manager’s duty to maintain the pool of talented and hard working employees fresh as they are the most valuable company’s asset that will help it excel in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shift Repeating Patterns</title>
   <link href="/blog/shift-repeating/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-03T09:39:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/shift-repeating</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being in business for many years, we’ve had an opportunity to meet and serve a wide variety of people coming from different industries. To our satisfaction, they’ve all recognized one of the most important values of our workforce management software - IT SAVES TIME. Plain and simple. To push the envelope a bit further, our developers and engineers paid special attention to certain functionalities that should cut down the time needed for automated employee scheduling even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of implementing various filters and tools, our team designed a set of shift repeating patterns with the idea to speed up the scheduling process and make things easier for managers and schedulers. In this step by step tutorial, we’re going to show you how to make the most of this useful feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you specify the exact start and end time of the shift as well as an optional shift label or note, you can set a specific shift to repeat by using any of the following automated patterns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Shift-Repeating-Patterns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee scheduling - Log Filter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Daily”&lt;/strong&gt; – This repeating pattern allows you to repeat the shift you are creating for a certain number of days in a row. There are two additional parameters you can configure once you set the “Daily” pattern: the number of days to repeat in a row OR a date when to complete the process of repeating. The end goal in both ways is for your shift to be repeated each day until a certain date or for a certain number of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Weekly”&lt;/strong&gt; – This shift repeating pattern allows you to repeat the shift you are creating for the same day of the week for a certain number of weeks in a row. Again, like with the previous pattern, you will have a chance to set the number of repeats, or simply select the date when you wish to end this repeating procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every weekday (Mon-Fri)”&lt;/strong&gt; – As the name suggests, this repeating pattern will simply repeat the shift you are creating on every day between Monday and Friday. Like with the previous patterns, you can set the number of repeating times, or you can simply select the end date by which you wish to end this Mon-Fri repeating process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every Tues, Thursday”&lt;/strong&gt; – In case you need a bit of un-ordinary repeating pattern, you can decide to repeat the shift you are creating on every Tuesday and Thursday, again for a certain number of times or simply end it by a specified date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every Mon, Wed and Fri”&lt;/strong&gt; – If  you need a bit of an unusual repeating pattern for your employees’ shifts, you can use this one and have a shift repeated on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for a certain number of times or simply until a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri and Sat”&lt;/strong&gt; – This repeating option will allow you to set your shift to repeat on every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. You can set this option to repeat for a certain number of times or end it on a selected date. With this pattern selected, you will cover all week days, except Wednesday and Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every Mon, Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat”&lt;/strong&gt; – This repeating option allows you to repeat a specific shift on every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. It can be repeated until the selected date is matched or for a specified number of times. With this option, you will cover all week days except for Thursday and Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri and Sat”&lt;/strong&gt; – With this option selected, you will have your shift repeated for all week days except Sunday. In case your employee needs to cover 6 days in a week, without Sunday, this is the right pattern to use. You can set it to repeat for a certain number of times or simply set the end on the desired date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every X days”&lt;/strong&gt; – Another popular repeating option allows you to repeat a certain shift every X days. Once you select it, you will have a chance to set the X variable to any desired number. Again, like with the previous options, you’ll have an opportunity to repeat this pattern for a certain number of times or just repeat it until a certain date is matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“On for X days, off for Y days”&lt;/strong&gt; – This is one of our more advanced repeating patterns. It allows you to repeat a shift for X days and then pause for Y days. When you select it, you will be able to select both X and Y variables so, for example, you can set a shift to repeat for 5 days, and pause for 2, or set it to repeat every 7 days, and then pause for 1 day. With this option, you’ll be able to select the date when you wish this repeating process to end.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stay on Top of All Changes – Introducing Audit Logs</title>
   <link href="/blog/introducing-audit-logs/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-02T12:01:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/introducing-audit-logs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Due to popular demand coming from our clients, especially from those managing larger teams in medium to large companies, we at NimbleSchedule decided to put some thought in that process and make it easier for administrators of such companies to stay on top of all changes. Hence, some while ago we introduced the Audit Log functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case your company has a lot of employees and especially a lot of managers and schedulers allowed to make changes to schedule or timesheets, then you will definitely find this functionality very useful. So far, we have covered the scheduling and the time clock/timesheet sections. In case you haven’t noticed these options before, you can find them in both the Schedule and the Time Clock section as the “Audit Log” option in the sub-menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schedule--audit-log&quot;&gt;Schedule – Audit Log&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audit-Log-Schedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audit-Log-Schedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Audit Log - Workforce scheduling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the screenshot above, this is one of our two currently active Audit Logs. This particular one contains all changes made to the schedule, across all locations. By using the Audit Log section, you will be able to stay on top of all changes made to your employee shifts. No more headaches and complaints that someone changed the schedule and no one knows who did that. Now, your employee scheduling process is an open book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the filter on top of that report, you can additionally refine the search and pull out just those specific records that you need to see. The screenshot below shows what exact events are covered by our schedule Audit Log, and on top of those specific events, you can choose to see only a specific employee or a specific date range. Our schedule Audit Log currently logs all changes made in the last 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audit-Log-Schedule-Filter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee scheduling - Log Filter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-clock--audit-log&quot;&gt;Time Clock – Audit Log&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audit-Log-Time-Clock.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audit-Log-Time-Clock-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Audit Log - Employee Time Clock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the similar manner, our Audit Log simply logs all actions and changes made through the Time Clock section. Every employee clocking in or out, every change to someone’s timesheet record or deletion is now being logged in the Time Clock Audit Log. Each of your managers is now accountable for the changes made to employees’ time clock entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the schedule section, there’s a Filter menu on top of the Audit Log in the Time Clock section. By clicking on the “Filter” button in the top left corner of the page, you’ll get a choice of filtering out just a specific employee, date range or event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audit-Log-Time-Clock-Filter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Clock - Log Filter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, we are covering only these two sections with our detailed Audit logs. We continue to work on the system improvements and hope to have all account related actions and changes covered by future Audit Logs we are planning on adding to the system. These options allow you to manage your company even better and stay on top of all actions and changes made through the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like these features, please do not hesitate to contact us and tell us your opinion. We’re here for you! In the meantime,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>8 Things That Kill Your Productivity</title>
   <link href="/blog/things-that-kill-your-productivity/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-01T12:04:25-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/things-that-kill-your-productivity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;**Productivity is of paramount importance no matter what you do for a living**.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, let’s focus on some of the things that usually kill productivity. With this knowledge in mind, you can try different approaches to minimize distractions and disruptions and put yourself in the mode of increased productivity.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/productivity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Distractions&lt;/strong&gt; probably deserve to be the first-place winner. With the advancement of technology, there are many websites, tools or apps that just simply kill your productivity or keep it at the minimum rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social networks are usually identified as one of such “evils” but there are certainly other websites and/or gadgets that could keep your attention occupied for a while instead of having you focused on your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from those techy distractions, there are certainly others, like a noisy and non-productive office environment. Even a noisy co-worker with the station next to yours can sometimes be a major annoyance distracting you from focusing on work; hence, some steps usually need to be taken to ensure a better and more professional working environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Indecisiveness&lt;/strong&gt; – another major concern, especially if you are on some hire ranking position in your company. Indecision may lag your work and decrease your productivity rapidly. Making the right decisions on time is an important task that will put you (and your team in case you are a team leader or a company manager) on the right path to conquer the next step of your project or plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Multitasking&lt;/strong&gt; – contrary to popular belief, it is proven that multitasking decreases productivity and ultimately gets to you complete less stuff. Furthermore, not only does multitasking slow down your work and destroy your productivity but it also decreases the quality of your work since attention to details becomes more blurry when you work on more than one thing at a time. Focusing on getting certain tasks and assignments one at a time may be a much better approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Disorganization&lt;/strong&gt; as well as disorder can be major reasons for reduced productivity. Remember to keep your work desk and environment well organized at all times so you can swiftly and easily handle different tasks and assignments. Can you find all files you need in less than a minute? Are all files on your desk properly organized and you know where each document is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Nitpicking&lt;/strong&gt;  could be another major reason for decreased productivity. While attention to details is usually a desirable characteristic, spending too much time on every tiny detail will just simply cause you to waste too much time on minor things. Being a perfectionist is one thing, but wasting too much time on trivial details is completely another. Draw the line between those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/strong&gt; including a lack of sleep or too many overtime hours can certainly lead to reduced productivity. It is important to have enough sleep and to be well rested when starting your work day. Skipping a night out here and there before another working day sounds like a good plan. Just an idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;strong&gt;Bad habits&lt;/strong&gt; including unhealthy food, or too much soda may lead your organism to spend too much time and energy on processing all that junk food and too much sugar. Getting rid of all those unhealthy habits, or at least keeping them at the absolute minimum is a smart thing to do, from both work-productivity perspective and your personal health perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) &lt;strong&gt;Being a “nice guy”&lt;/strong&gt; and saying “Yes” to everything is sometimes a certain way to kill your productivity completely. Helping your colleagues is a nice thing to do, but you can’t do it always and interrupt your work and focus while doing some important work. Delaying a response on some of the emails may also create a better working environment for you while keeping your focus on your work. Some things could wait, it’s just up to you to filter the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule - A Technology-Rich Time Clock System</title>
   <link href="/blog/time-clock-system/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-01T11:26:31-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/time-clock-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the moment our company was founded and our employee scheduling system released, we thought about ways to provide our prospects and clients with a functionality and technology rich system that would work across different industries. Even companies themselves approached us with various requests that all made sense. Based on such inquiries, our team worked on finding and designing the optimal hardware and software solutions that would easily fit across different companies and different needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some hard work by all our departments and engineers, we now possess one of the technology and feature richest Time Clock systems on the market. At this moment we are supporting the following time &amp;amp; attendance technologies and methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Computer/Web panel based Time Clock
• A Smart phone time clock app that supports iOS and Android
• A QR Code Scan method, working on iPad and Android tablets
• Time Clock via Text/SMS message
• Time Clock via Phone call (Call-in)
• Biometric devices / Fingerprint scanners
• Plus, a feature rich API system that allows the development of third party applications, including the Time Clocking component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web panel based Time Clock&lt;/strong&gt; allows all computer, or even tablet and mobile phone users to access the “desktop” version of our web panel and, among other functionalities, use our Time Clock system as well. Clocking in and out is super easy - all you have to do is click on the big button on your screen and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/NS-Time-Clock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Technology-Rich Time Clock System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of simply monitoring the Time Clock entries, administrators can also define Clock Locations and restrict their employees to clock in/out from specific networks only. This allows employers to allow their employees to clock in only from their office computers, while leaving the possibility to employees to access the rest of the system from any computer they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart phone apps&lt;/strong&gt; – This is an optional feature that allows employers to choose whether or not they wish to enable employee clocking in/out via smart phones. Currently, we are supporting iOS and Android phones. With each such time clock entry, employees leave a GPS stamp which allows administrators and managers to determine the exact location on the map from which their employees clocked in. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QR Code Scan&lt;/strong&gt; – By downloading and installing our additional Time Clock app for iPad or Android tablets, employers can now create a clock post with the use of their device, somewhere in their store or a restaurant, and allow their employees to clock in/out by flashing their printed QR Code card in front of the tablet. Our software was designed to quickly process such a request thus allowing large number of employees to clock in one after another without holding a line too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Clock via Text message&lt;/strong&gt; allows company owners and administrators to allow specific employees to clock in and out by simply sending a text message. Not everyone today has a smart phone or a computer, especially not in some type of industries where employees need to visit a remote location to complete some task. In such cases, clocking in by sending a text message is a quick and easy way to handle this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biometric Time Clock devices&lt;/strong&gt; – NimbleSchedule offers a wide range of different devices you can utilize for your Time &amp;amp; Attendance needs. Choose among a variety of USB fingerprint scanners that need to be attached to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt; - On top of all other methods, our feature rich API system offers third party companies to utilize our system, as well as our Time Clock and build a custom software solution according to their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have really invested a lot of time in designing all these different options just for you. In case you like what you see here, and you would like to hear more, please do not hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/demo-request/&quot;&gt;schedule a demo&lt;/a&gt; session with one of our experts or reach out to our friendly sales team. Our experts will definitely assist you in finding the best time clock scanners for your business and for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How To Climb The Corporate Ladder</title>
   <link href="/blog/climb-the-corporate-ladder/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-26T09:44:38-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/climb-the-corporate-ladder</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have decided to build a career in a medium or large corporation, then you are probably wondering how to get promoted with that many employees around you. Assuming that you are not with that company from day one, then chances are pretty high that the company already has all their management positions filled in with excellent employees. But then, what should you do? How to get noticed by corporate executives and supervisors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/get-promoted.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/get-promoted-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Career Advice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show initiative from day one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All supervisors and executives like those employees that show initiative for certain work areas. Of course, you’ll need to draw the line on where initiative ends and where you are actually doing work that should be done only with approval of the manager or supervisor. Hence, be careful not to cross that line for the sake of your reputation, especially if you are a new employee in the company. On the other hand, thinking and working on resolving some of the on-going issues is a good direction. Proposing a solution for some of the problems managers or other employees face in your company is a good way to get some attention from those from the floor “above” and present yourself as a problem solver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be innovative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fresh employee in a corporation where everyone got used to handling problems and issues in a certain way, being innovative could get you some credits. Bringing some new ideas to the table could be that wind in the back that your team needs; therefore, do not hesitate to state your ideas and propose a new approach to solving some of the internal issues or enhancing the company’s products or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volunteer for new projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteering for any new projects that come along the way is another good way to get noticed by your supervisors or company executives. Raising your hand too often could be taken as a sign of being a bit too pushy and trying to work on everything, but do not miss the opportunity to volunteer for projects or tasks where you think your skills could really shine. This will be a great opportunity for you to meet other corporate employees outside your department, leave your office and expand your presence in other divisions as well as learn how your company works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support team members and mentor newcomers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a supportive team player is a must, especially when working in a larger corporation with large teams. This is a habit everyone should exercise so be there for your team members, if not to help them throughout the work day, then at least to show some support when they do something positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your company expends and hires new team members, showing that you are ready to mentor them and help them get up to speed is a nice way to present yourself as a positive person supporting your company growth. With this kind of a positive attitude toward your co-workers and new team members you could be perceived as an engine of your team that deserves to move up the corporate ladder as soon as the first next opportunity emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Open Shifts</title>
   <link href="/blog/open-shifts/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-24T12:19:04-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/open-shifts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are already a NimbleSchedule user, then perhaps you noticed another new page we added during our latest update. It’s simply called “Open Shifts”.  After hearing multiple similar requests from our clients, our developers and UI experts made an effort to build this easy to use, yet extremely useful feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick glance on the default view of our new “Open Shifts” page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OpenShifts1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OpenShifts1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Shifts - Work Schedule Maker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, all the data will collapse into location sub-divisions. As you can see on the screenshot above, there are two locations on this demo account: Los Angeles HQ with 43 open shifts and San Francisco with 31 open shift. From this quick overview, you can easily see the number of open shifts for each of your locations as well as some basic info about your locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the filter on top of that page, you can slightly re-adjust the date range for your data and have a better overview of available open shifts. Initially, the filter will cover the following month starting from the current date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you click on the blue bar representing one of your locations, the whole table with the data should expand below. The data will be nicely formatted, looking pretty much the same like shown on the screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OpenShifts2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OpenShifts2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open Shifts - Employee Schedule Maker&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table should show the position name in the first column along with the number of shifts created for that specific time slot and that position. The next column will simply display the optional shift label, followed by the date and time of that open shift. On the far right you’ll be able to see the edit and delete icons allowing you to perform certain actions with those shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as usual, managers will have access to their assigned locations only, as well as schedulers. Employees using our scheduling software will be restricted from viewing this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple to use overview should allow administrators and managers of companies with a lot of open shifts to easily monitor the availability of open shifts so that they can efficiently fill them in. Although this feature is a perfect fit for numerous medium and large companies using our system, smaller companies will also benefit from it especially if wanting to stay on top of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team will continue to work on bringing new features and updates. As our aim is to make the scheduling process even easier and hassle-free, we plan on adding more functionalities that will make our scheduling software even more useful than it currently is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy NimbleScheduling!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Working With Your Spouse</title>
   <link href="/blog/working-with-your-spouse/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-22T11:17:48-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/working-with-your-spouse</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whatever reason got you into working with your spouse, you may have already discovered that there are both pros and cons of doing so. While this could potentially be the best experience in your life, it may also ruin your marriage, due to unforeseen side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Here are a few tips that may help you preserve your marriage happiness and keep a healthy business relationship with your spouse. 
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[![Spouses Working Together](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spouses-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spouses.jpg)
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; **1. Be respectful to each other.** Even though this should already be the case, especially when it comes to your personal relationship with your spouse, it can’t hurt to repeat this one more time. This may sound a bit silly but do not shy away from adding “Please” to each of your work requests directed to your spouse in the working environment, or saying “Thank you” once some important part of the work has been completed or an important report has been filed. 

**2. Physical distance may be important.** To what extent this claim could be accurate actually depends on the personalities you both have. Ideally, each partner should have some time to spend with his or her thoughts and some personal space. So, even if you both work from home, maintaining separate work rooms should be a great idea.

**3. Don’t take your work home and vice versa.** It is essential to keep your work life separate from your personal relationship with your spouse. Although that line may occasionally become blurry, it is important to make an effort to maintain those two things as separate as possible. If your spouse forgot to file a report within the deadline, do not keep a cold relationship at home over that. The same goes in the opposite case. If your spouse forgot to vacuum the living room, there’s no reason to ignore him or her that whole day at work. 

**4. Maintain separate work roles.** Generally speaking, each individual is talented for a different aspect of business. With that being said, it is probably a wise idea to handle different work duties on multiple levels. Crossing paths and duties with your spouse too frequently may lead into all kinds of conflicts, so maintaining a different role from him or her may be an excellent idea for all spouses working together.

**5. Trust is an important factor.** In both your marriage and work relationship with your spouse, trust plays an extremely important role. If you just don’t have enough faith in your spouse that he or she will complete a certain task properly and on time, then you risk ruining your personal relationship with your spouse as well. Hence, maintaining the trust bar level high is a very important task.

**6. Marriage should be the priority at all times.** When the lines between your work life and personal life start blurring too much, or when one of the partners starts feeling stressed because of the whole situation, you must have a clear picture about your priority. That should definitely be your marriage. If working with your spouse is just not working out properly, you should both consider ways to solve that problem and, if needed, one of you should be ready for a career change.

   <title>How to Get More People in Your Restaurant</title>
   <link href="/blog/get-people-restaurant/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-21T21:40:12-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/get-people-restaurant</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Restaurant managers and owners are incessantly looking for new ideas to promote their business and attract more customers. There is no excuse for letting down your crew and jeopardizing your business because you were not thinking out of the box when it comes to promoting your restaurant. In this article we will share a couple of restaurant marketing ideas that require no or minimum funds invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://assets.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/restaurant-management.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/restaurant-management-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Restaurant Marketing Ideas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Good music&lt;/strong&gt; – This is one of those things you must have if you run a restaurant. Your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/profiling-your-customers/&quot;&gt;targeted audience&lt;/a&gt; will dictate a type of music you want to play in your restaurant. For example, if you run an Italian restaurant, then pleasant Italian canzone should be your best choice. On the other hand, if you are trying to attract younger guests, then being familiar with currently popular hits is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Meeting the neighbors&lt;/strong&gt; is another very good way to attract customers to your restaurant. Companies in your neighborhood hire people that need to have breakfast and lunch on a daily basis, right? Why wouldn’t you put your restaurant in their minds by reaching out to your neighbors once in a while to remind them you are there for them. Handing out a couple of complimentary drinks to your neighbors could be a good tactic to establish the initial relationship with the first regular customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Hand out attractive leaflets&lt;/strong&gt; – An excellent way to start promoting your business is to print out attractive looking leaflets and hand them out to hand-picked group of people or people passing by. Another approach that people frequently use is printing out such leaflets and simply sticking them out on the windshields of parked cars, which is not as effective as personal handing out of such promo material. Just an idea to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Kick-start a discount&lt;/strong&gt; – Even though you just started your restaurant business and you probably invested a large portion of your savings, if not everything you had, you still have to attract somehow your future customers. Carefully designing a promotional discount, somewhere around 20%, could be a great idea to attract instant customers. 20% seems as an ideal number because it’s not too large for you to go instantly bankrupt, and it is not too small making your potential customers simply ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Theme days or evenings&lt;/strong&gt; – Although not all people would jump on the idea to dress in the style of 40’s or wear all white, organizing some kind of theme days or evenings makes things interesting and gives a reason to your customers to talk about your restaurant to others. Forcing customers to participate in your theme is to be avoided, of course, but at least your personal or restaurant ambient can be slightly adjusted for such events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Happy hours&lt;/strong&gt; – Organizing happy hours somewhere around the time when people usual finish their work or start going out in the evening is a lucrative way to attract new visitors to your business. Having all prices lowered or cut in half during that hour might cost you some money you would usually make; however, it will get people hurdling to your restaurant during those hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;strong&gt;The ambiance is a value&lt;/strong&gt; – Depending on your target audience, your restaurant could be arranged and organized in one way or another. If you are trying to attract young customers, then you definitely need to make your place look “In”. Having great decorations that would give the new generation a reason to take pictures in your restaurant and share it across the social media, spreading the word about your business, is a lucid approach to get some free marketing for your restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story doesn’t end here! There are numerous effective ways how to attract customers to your restaurant – we’ve singled out the most important ones. If you would like to share some of your thoughts with us, please do not hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. We would love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Women as Managers</title>
   <link href="/blog/women-as-managers/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-20T11:11:50-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/women-as-managers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not a novelty any more to see women occupying high corporate positions; however, if we take a look at what statistics have to say on this, it can be concluded that only 5% of privileged positions are held by women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a collection of tips and guidelines offered by best women managers around the globe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	&lt;strong&gt;Choose your associates carefully&lt;/strong&gt; - if in a position to choose, always work with competent people and do not feel jeopardized if they are more experienced or competent than you. Make the most of their talents and learn from them. Present your advantages and talents, but at the same time, be ready to respect the ones possessed by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	&lt;strong&gt;Be polite&lt;/strong&gt; - try to show respectfulness and politeness at all times and be careful how you treat your subordinates and people, in general. Such behavior is not just part of workplace etiquette but is expected in any kind of interpersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	&lt;strong&gt;Motivate your team&lt;/strong&gt; - your team is your most valuable asset. Once you have set the expectations and goals, give your team members freedom to express themselves and their creativity. As a reward, they will help you achieve great results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	&lt;strong&gt;Be persistent and believe in yourself&lt;/strong&gt; - setbacks are normal and they are human. As there will always be obstacles in your business and personal life, do not let them get you down. On the contrary, let them make you even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/womenmanagers.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/womenmanagers-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Women Managers in the Workplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	&lt;strong&gt;Be yourself&lt;/strong&gt; - do not accept the preconception that women should be warm or sweet by default. Always be who you are and not who you are expected to be. After all, acting is not a good choice in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do sometimes have split opinions on women as managers but we must admit that without these women, our world would not look the way it does. They made our lives easier and more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take this quiz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and check your general knowledge about women’s contribution to the mankind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. In 1919, this lady invented the gas heating furnace. It can be said that without her invention, we wouldn’t have central heating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patricia Billings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice Parker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margaret Knight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This lady invented a home surveillance device in 1969 and her invention represents the forerunner to the modern surveillance systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie Van Brittan Brown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruth Handler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sally Fox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

   <title>Restrict Employees to Scheduled Position</title>
   <link href="/blog/restrict-employees-to-scheduled-position/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-18T09:59:30-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/restrict-employees-to-scheduled-position</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The idea of having more options and more flexibility built into the system is always met with approval by our respective clients. With that in mind, we at Nimble Software System Inc are continually working on adding more functionalities thus making our system even more feature-rich with every update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge we met was that different companies, depending on their organization and scheduling habits, frequently have not only different requests but also completely opposing requests when it comes to a certain part of the system and the way it works. Generally, some managers and administrators simply wish to have more control over what their employees do through the system and over the way certain things are handled. Others, on the other hand, prefer to give more freedom and flexibility to their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more precise, when an employee has more than one position assigned on his profile, the question is whether you want to allow him to be able to select one of those positions on his own while clocking out, or not? We had heard reasonable arguments from both sides which is why we decided to go the extra mile and simply satisfy everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to present you the new “Restrict employees to scheduled position” option in the Time Clocking section of the Settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RestrictEmployeesToScheduledPosition.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RestrictEmployeesToScheduledPosition-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Restrict Employees to Scheduled Position&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you visit the Time Clocking section of the Settings area, you should be able to see this new “Restrict employees to scheduled position” option near the bottom of the page. Enabling this option and saving the setting will restrict your employees with multiple positions from being able to switch their position to any other than the one they were actually scheduled for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those managers or administrators trying to stay on top of everything your employees do and have more control yet less work while supervising the whole time clocking process, then you will certainly appreciate this new option. It can come extremely handy if you have employees working on multiple positions with different pay rates. Having a better control over the process of position selection in such case is a must if you wish to control all the costs you are due to pay when running the next payroll report. Once you enable this new option, and your employees clock in, the drop down with different positions that used to appear for the clock-out process will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RestrictEmployeesToScheduledPosition2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RestrictEmployeesToScheduledPosition2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Time Clock Position&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see on the screenshot above, the drop down menu is gone. Your employee will not be able to change his position during the clock out process and he will be automatically assigned with the position you scheduled him for. On the other hand, if you allow your employees to clock in without even being scheduled, your employees will again have a drop-down selection menu to choose the appropriate position they worked on during that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that having more flexibility while creating your rules for the system usage is appreciated. Therefore, we will continue to work on creating other useful features and solutions that will save you both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think about our new option? Do you find it handy? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/&quot;&gt;We look forward to hearing from you&lt;/a&gt;!
Until then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Get Customer Referrals</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-get-customer-referrals/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-12T09:24:28-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-get-customer-referrals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the best and most cost-effective ways of getting more leads is getting customer referrals. Period. Many sales experts frequently point out that there is no more powerful tool than getting referrals from your satisfied clients. In particular, customer satisfaction spread via word of mouth referrals can boost your business on so many levels once you create a base of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-build-customer-loyalty/&quot;&gt;loyal and happy customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good and bad way to ask your existing clients for referrals, as well as a good and a bad timing. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-become-a-great-sales-person/&quot;&gt;good sales person&lt;/a&gt; would simply tell you that by mastering the art of getting referrals from your happy clients takes time and learning, but there are definitely some tips and tricks that can get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/customer-satisfaction.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/customer-satisfaction-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customer Satisfaction - Thumb Up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Making the client happy.&lt;/strong&gt; Above anything else, the first and the most important step should be to make your existing client happy. Let’s face it, you will never get a referral from an unsatisfied client. All that you can get from such a client is a bad publicity; hence, making and keeping your clients happy is an imperative. Make it a routine to ask your clients for feedback once in a while and then re-evaluate your efforts. Based on such feedback you can have a clear picture of whether or not you are on the right path and what needs to be slightly re-adjusted to get better results. Once you sort everything out, and you become sure that at least a majority of your clients are happy with your product or a service, hoping to get customer referrals is a more realistic thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Asking for referrals.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, you could just sit and do nothing and go with a famous theory: “If they are happy with my service, they will recommend me to others on their own”. And you are not that far from the truth; however, you can surely do various things to help your clients do that a bit better and make it easier for them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;recommend your business&lt;/a&gt; to others. If your communication with clients is usually handled through emails, chats, or similar systems, then make sure to add links leading them to review websites or to recommendation tools so that your clients could have an easy way to recommend you to their friends or business contacts. By making this process significantly easier for them, you will boost your chances to get more referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Pick the right time to ask.&lt;/strong&gt; Like with everything else in business, or even in life, there is a right time and a bad time to ask for something. Choosing the right moment to ask for a referral from your client could make a difference between succeeding and failing with that process. Note that you can embarrass yourself in front of the client if you choose a totally inappropriate moment to do that. Asking for a referral before you even make a sale is too soon. You will definitely waste your chance to get a referral and you may even create a reputation of being too pushy in the eyes of your client. Waiting too long after the sale has been made is another bad decision as your client may forget about the benefits he has gained from your product or a service, and as with everything in life, he may start taking it for granted. Depending on the nature of your product or a service, the right timing should be around the time when your client discovers true benefits of your product or service and gets excited about it. That process could take a bit longer if some kind of training or learning is involved along the way. On the other hand, always keep in mind that you should strike while the iron is hot.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Start a Business Online</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-start-a-business-online/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-11T10:15:44-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-start-a-business-online</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Establishing an online business can be a wise step toward marketing and selling your great product or a service. As with any startup, online or offline, there are certain challenges to consider and pitfalls to avoid. Knowing some of these things prior to investing your time and money into your newly founded online business could make a distinction between success and failure. On the other hand, if you already have a plan, it could be a nice idea to go through this list to make sure you have all these things covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business needs to:
• Solve the problem for your potential clients
• Have a professional looking website
• Be slightly different from your competitors
• Drive traffic to your website
• Share your expert opinions and content with others 
• Sell, sell and then sell some more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bright-idea.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bright-idea-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Business Idea&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve the problem for your potential clients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to starting a business, make sure that the product or service you intend to offer actually solves a problem your potential clients have. Take some time to read as many online blogs and forums as possible regarding the industry niche you are interested in and see if there is actually an interest in what you have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do some research and see what kind of problems your targeted industry members actually experience and what kind of products or services they need to solve some of their problems. No matter if you intend to market for other businesses or clients, this procedure should be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a professional looking website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right domain name and designing a professional looking website should be your first step. This is your chance to shine in the same way like those multi-billion dollar companies. Nothing prevents you from having a better looking and more functional website than most of those large corporations, so take some time to think through this process and don’t scrimp in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing when it comes to the website is to have a good and reliable web host. There is nothing worse than having a beautifully designed website with a great product or service, and at the same time that website being down for 20% of the time due to a poorly selected web hosting company. Therefore, take some time to find the right host, with the most reliable servers and the best uptime guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be slightly different from your competitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having parts of your online business similar or the same as some of your competitors is alright. Even large industry giants sometimes copy what others do, as long as a personal touch is added. However, having everything the same like your competitors without any distinction is a risk. If such is the case, why should your potential clients choose you instead of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having some competitive advantage over your competitors is a must. Invest some time and energy in creating distinctive points between you and competitors and make sure to highlight those distinctions clearly to all your website visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive traffic to your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any website needs traffic, right? There’s no point in having a website without a decent number of visitors that could generate some income for your business. There is more than one way to get those visitors but, of course, nothing is stopping you to use all these ways to get more visitors. Usual ways to get visitors include social media activities, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/email-marketing/&quot;&gt;email opt-in marketing&lt;/a&gt;, search engine optimization and paid advertising (per click, per sale, per lead, or any other method). If you are eager to start selling, the easiest way to get new visitors instantly is to pay for ads through various websites or search engines. Instant visitors could mean an instant cash flow for your business as well, but be careful when investing too much money in such advertising and make sure you are targeting the right audience. Measure the results and performance of those paid ads as often as possible to stay on top of your costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share your expert opinions and content with others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to establish your presence at the market and drive more traffic or even more experts to your website is to share your knowledge with others. Writing content that could be shared through blogs or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; is one way to do this. Offering your free content to a third party blog or article websites is another way to establish your name among industry experts and get leads to your website by including links to your site in such content. When other websites link back to your site, search engines will recognize it as being valuable, which will result in your website being better ranked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell, sell and then sell some more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, you have covered all important steps and basics and it is time to sell. Be sure to create a clear offer to your website visitors. Display all relevant information followed by pricing info, if your type of product or service allows that and make a direct offer to your website visitors. The hardest part, and probably the most expensive one, is to make your website visitors buy something from you for the first time. Once they interact with your business and become clients, use that opportunity to offer similar products or services to them and try to repeat the sale with your existing clients. There is a big chance that clients that already purchased something from you will buy again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-build-customer-loyalty/&quot;&gt;Creating a loyal client base&lt;/a&gt; from your one-time purchases is an important step toward selling more and selling better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Find the Perfect Business Partner</title>
   <link href="/blog/perfect-business-partnership/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-10T12:05:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/perfect-business-partnership</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finding a partner for your small business is one of the best ways to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-raise-money/&quot;&gt;get more capital&lt;/a&gt; for your ideas and achieve business success. But beware - such partnerships can also destroy your company if you do not make a wise business partnership choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/business-partnership.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/business-partnership-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Small Business Partners&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many widely known companies were started as partnerships. For example, the IT giant, Microsoft, was founded on the wings of successful cooperation between Bill Gates and Paul Allen. This and many similar examples from various industries prove that successful business partnerships can lead to great success. On the other hand, according to Noah Wasserman, a professor at Harvard Business School, 65% of high-potential startups fail as a result of conflict among co-founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to point out some of the most frequent pain points of a business partnership and offer concise guidelines on how to better look for your future business partner, we have made a collection of tips that you are certain to find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your own strengths and weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand your future role in the company, you need to be fully aware of your own strengths and weaknesses in the first place. Take some time to assess your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/7-ways-to-improve-your-interpersonal-skills/&quot;&gt;personal skills&lt;/a&gt; and try to be as realistic as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for a partner that you genuinely trust and like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many people may argue that trust is being built over time, there has to be a good starting point and trust to build upon. Finding the right partner that you genuinely like sets your business on the right path of avoiding some of the possible conflicts in the future. In case there is some animosity from the very beginning, and clear distrust, then such business partnerships should definitely be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek a partner that shares the same values as you do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having different approaches towards solving various issues your future company may experience is to be expected; however, such differences can certainly be drastically minimized should you have a partner that shares the same values like you do. Whether those values focus on work ethics or commitment to family, the point here is - the more similarities you have with your future partner – the better your future partnership will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a couple of one-time projects first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent way to get to know your future partner better is to have a couple of smaller one-time projects working together. Even if those small projects are not set to make you billions or even to make any significant income, the sheer benefit of getting to know your potential partner better and learning more about his ethic and skills is an important aspect of such an endeavor. Finding out that your future partner likes to cheat or that he has some really &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/bad-workplace-habits/&quot;&gt;bad habits&lt;/a&gt; that could drive your future partnership company into bankruptcy is an important thing to learn prior to investing all your life savings into a business partnership with such a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the plan for success, but think about the exit strategy as well&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a great business plan is definitely a good foundation for the future success. Still, it is argued that having a clear exit strategy is a smart thing to do at the very beginning. Hence, it would be a wise idea to define a “what-if” plan for the scenario in which your mutual company results go south. In other words having a document that clearly defines the minimum success level for the continuance of partnership and conditions for leaving the partnership is a wise step to take. Agreeing with your potential partner about these terms and conditions could make a difference between having a nightmare split up with your partner or having a gracious end of unsuccessful business partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Good Money Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-manage-money/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-04T11:48:23-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-manage-money</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Establishing good money management is an important step in securing your company’s success, no matter if you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/skills-of-successful-entrepreneurs/&quot;&gt;run a startup business&lt;/a&gt; 3 months old, or a well-established company being on the market for many years. Even if you decide to hire a professional bookkeeper or an accountant, you should still cover the basics if you wish to lead your company properly. Here are 6 tips on how to manage money:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/good-money-management.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/good-money-management-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Manage Money&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening a bank account&lt;/strong&gt; for your newly founded business is probably the first step that needs to be done after official registration of your startup. Finding the right bank with the best terms for your business may be slightly time consuming, yet it’s very important. Make sure you dedicate enough time and attention to &lt;em&gt;the terms and conditions each of the banks offers&lt;/em&gt; so you could make an intelligent choice. While obtaining all pieces of information, make sure to check on optional credit limits, credit card options and other small business services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provide as &lt;strong&gt;many means of payment&lt;/strong&gt; for your clients as possible. All companies in early stages of their development need to go the extra mile in order to get new clients and keep the existing ones happy. When it comes to payment options, customers simply expect some flexibility. Having only cash as your payment method or accepting only credit/debit cards is not enough anymore. &lt;em&gt;The more payment options you have, the more clients you will get&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, be aware not to provide too many options which will make your income scattered among many different systems thus making it harder to track transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share the burden&lt;/strong&gt; whenever possible. As a company owner, you probably have a strong need to stay on top of all income and outcome transactions in order to ensure success of your business. However, sometimes that can be extremely overwhelming; hence, ensuring assistance in this area by an &lt;em&gt;external bookkeeper or accountant is a great idea&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, if you have just registered your company, you probably do not have enough financial resources to hire a full time employee to manage that part of the work, so occasional supervision done by a professional is an excellent option. Hiring an accountant to go through your bills and tax forms once in a while is a smart choice, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a budget&lt;/strong&gt; for all projects and departments. If you deal with multiple departments in your company or you have many ongoing projects covered by different team members, then it is crucial to have a &lt;em&gt;strictly defined budget&lt;/em&gt; covering each area. A clearly defined budget can efficiently rein different expenditures and keep your company costs under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assign money you have to &lt;strong&gt;specific goals and purposes&lt;/strong&gt;. Experts frequently point out that the money you do not assign to a specific &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-reach-your-goals/&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; is more vulnerable to reckless spending. Consequently, it is a wise idea to have &lt;em&gt;each dollar allotted to a specific objective&lt;/em&gt; which clearly shows to all your associates and employees that you do not have money to waste. Ultimately, splitting up your income among costs and various projects should help you stay on top of all expenses. On the other hand, this should not stop you from possibly having a secret/reserved stash for tough times any business experience occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a &lt;strong&gt;wise debt collection routine&lt;/strong&gt;. Inevitably you will have to deal with clients that forget or try to avoid paying on time. Therefore, it is optimal to have a well-developed routine process for such cases. &lt;em&gt;Carefully examine your best options&lt;/em&gt; that may slightly differ depending on your industry or circumstances and persistently enforce such debt collection routine. Legal intimidation is not always the best choice, so first try with a set of pleasant reminder calls, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/creating-emails-worth-opening/&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; or personal visits. Moreover, by consistently reminding your client that it is in their best interest to keep your business relation in a good shape, you can achieve a very solid debt collection rate. As a last resort, if no other options available, remind your client of possible legal repercussions if they fail to pay for your products or services.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to finance the growth of your business. No matter if you have been running a company for 3 days, or 5 years, any kind of cash flow that would boost up your business is always welcome. Depending on the exact business plan and industry niche, various methods may work in certain situations. Here, we will present you with a couple of ways to raise money from different sources, with all the advantages and pitfalls of each method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/raising-money.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/raising-money-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Raise Money&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friends--family&quot;&gt;Friends &amp;amp; Family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising funds for a startup business from friends and family is one of the very popular approaches. It is quite frequently the easiest and most convenient way to obtain funding for a startup company since friends and family care about their beloved ones and want to see them succeed. On the other hand, there are certain pitfalls of this funding method. Statistics show that the percentage of startup businesses that fail in the first couple of years is pretty high. Hence, such a failure could lead to ruined personal relationships with your closest ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crowd-funding&quot;&gt;Crowd funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of years there has been a rise of popularity of websites where individuals or small business owners come with their ideas and ask general audience to fund their business with their personal funds contribution. Due to the increase of popularity of this funding method, legal changes have been initiated in order to adjust certain laws to even further improve such method of business funding. Contributors usually base their investments on a reward model, quite frequently that being a service or a product that will be offered by the start company they invest in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bank-loans&quot;&gt;Bank loans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless the world economic crisis, a decent number of startup businesses continue to raise loans from banks for their innovative business ideas. Even though banks require all sorts of guarantees that your business will pay them back, this is still the most popular way of business funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;angel-investors&quot;&gt;Angel investors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After succeeding in business with their own startups, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/skills-of-successful-entrepreneurs/&quot;&gt;successful entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; are frequently willing to re-invest some of their hard earned capital into other startup companies. Such investors are called “Angel” investors. Besides the sheer funding, angel investors can significantly contribute to startup businesses with their business connections and advice. Therefore, this kind of funding and cooperation can be beneficial on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;venture-capitalist-investors&quot;&gt;Venture capitalist investors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture capitalists are those investors that provide capital to companies in an early stage of their development, when they need additional funds to expand to other markets or to cover additional products or costs. Although this kind of investment carries one of the largest risks for venture capitalists, the chances of high returns appear to be worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-partners&quot;&gt;Business partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding another partner, or more partners for your startup ideas and business is an excellent solution in cases where you just don’t have enough funds to get the ball rolling. Nevertheless, it is very important to find a person with a similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/keep-your-small-business-focused/&quot;&gt;business goal&lt;/a&gt; and way of thinking as yours. Starting up a new business with another person and then finding out after a while that they have a completely different set of goals or ideas on how to do business can make a nightmare of your life. Hence, it is advisable to have some sort of a buyout agreement arranged at the very beginning in order to easily handle difficult situations later on should one or more partners just simply decide to leave the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips For Naming Your Business</title>
   <link href="/blog/tips-for-naming-your-business/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-29T09:58:37-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/tips-for-naming-your-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When starting a new business, founders very often leave the business name for later or they dedicate just a small amount of time to think that part through. What seems as a fairly easy thing to do is actually a very tricky part that could cause your business to suffer in the future should your name not be as recognizable as possible. Hence, if you are about to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-fund-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;start your own business&lt;/a&gt; and you are wondering where to get ideas for business name, here are some tips you should consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Pick a name that has some meaning&lt;/em&gt;. Although you may be tempted to make up some word that has no real world meaning just because it’s easier to find an available website address, that idea should definitely be avoided. If you are just starting your business and do not have millions in your marketing budget to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-brand-awareness/&quot;&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; around some nice sounding abbreviation of a name or a made up word as a name, then do not even try that. Make it easier for your customers to find you when searching online and make it easier for them to recommend your business to friends by having a name that’s easy to remember and makes some sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/name-puzzle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern business names&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Make sure your name sounds good when you say it loud&lt;/em&gt;. When you definitely pick the name for your company, make sure that the name you have chosen is easy to pronounce and is no-brainer when it comes to spelling. Imagine the situation where a person that heard of your company from someone needs to find your business via Google. Will they know how to spell it properly before re-typing the name 5 times in the search box? Or if they decide to recommend your company name to a friend or partner, will they have to think about how to pronounce it properly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Be specific, but don’t be TOO specific&lt;/em&gt;. It is generally a good idea to avoid too generic names that can easily get lost in the sea of generic names on the banners page or on the search engines. Therefore, having a name that clearly gives a hint about the industry and possible products you might have is a good way to handle that. On the other hand, being too specific may prevent you from growing in the future. While you may have an excellent plan and strategy for your start-up and you believe you already know all the details, be aware that no one knows what future might bring. What will happens if in a year or two you decide to expand your business to some other areas or industries? Will your business name limit you in any way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/company-name.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/company-name-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Where to get ideas for business name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Check if your chosen name is already taken&lt;/em&gt;. Use the Internet to check if there are already companies with the same or similar name in your or other states. That kind of obstacle could be a major one should your business start flourishing in the future and you decide to go nation-wide instead of focusing on your state or city. Spend some time checking your shortlisted name ideas and use government websites to check those brand-protected names. Don’t forget social media channels as they can also help you check if any similar names have already been taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;It will never be perfect&lt;/em&gt;. Make peace with the fact that not everyone will always like your modern business names. There will always be people that will dislike it. Hence, in case you hired a team of professionals or you are just bouncing a couple of ideas with your friends, try to do that with a smaller group of people. With too many people you just risk having a bunch of different opinions clash and that won’t be as helpful as you hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Stick with your choice&lt;/em&gt;! So, you have chosen a name for your business and started using it for a while, but not all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-give-and-receive-criticism/&quot;&gt;reactions of people&lt;/a&gt; coming in interaction with you and your company are positive? Well, don’t change your business name too lightly! Think that through. Unless it’s completely necessary and inevitable, don’t change it at all. But, if you really have to, then make sure that this time you select a proper business name.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Skills of Successful Entrepreneurs</title>
   <link href="/blog/skills-of-successful-entrepreneurs/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-27T12:17:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/skills-of-successful-entrepreneurs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, you have a great idea that you believe will revolutionize the world or at least the market once you release your product or a service? Ok, hold that thought and stay in the line with others who think exactly the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an entrepreneur is so much more than just having a great idea about what may conquer the world. Polishing the entrepreneur’s most important skills will definitely help you on your path to success. In case you do not have all the right skills aligned, do not despair. No one was actually born with entrepreneurial skills - they are acquired along the way. Therefore, we have prepared  a list of business musts for all entrepreneurs who want to be successful in their fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/entrepreneurs.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/entrepreneurs-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Successful Entrepreneurs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being aware of the big picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While being an expert in your own domain is a desirable skill to have, seeing a big picture is a must for every successful entrepreneur. Having a clear vision of how business works, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-fund-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;how to obtain funding for your small business&lt;/a&gt;, or how to choose the right technology are just some of the parameters that can either make or break your plan. There’s no point in investing any amount of money in a technology that is simply outdated or too complicated to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love what you do – do what you love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because there is an opportunity in some industry to offer some kind of a service or a product doesn’t mean that you should necessarily give up your dreams and do a job that you hate. Start the business in the area that you love working on and put your passion into action. If you do what you love on a daily basis, your chances of succeeding will rapidly increase. That’s not just a nice romantic story, that’s a fact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” - Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk some strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan, plan and then plan some more! Having a good plan in front of you is a smart thing to do. With a good plan written down, and a smart strategy on how to implement it, you can circle back to your plans and strategies at any time. Whenever you complete some portion of your project or even every couple of months, you can put your work on test and compare it to what you previously planned. Are you still on track? Should you slightly re-adjust your strategy to the original one to stay on the right path? Re-evaluate your success repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape up your salesman skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what if you are just a tech guy or a good handyman? You need good sales skills in any kind of business communication with any instance. Even if you are just negotiating about inventory purchase or you are chit-chatting with some partner about possible resale deal, you need a set of good salesperson skills! You can have an excellent sales team behind you that will handle such work in your company, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-become-a-great-sales-person/&quot;&gt;having good sales skills&lt;/a&gt; will benefit you. Work on them constantly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand yourself and your business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that on every step of your work you need to promote yourself and your business as the right choice for your clients. Many companies report that majority of their revenue comes from returning clients. While there is nothing wrong in winning new clients, you must dedicate your full attention to keeping your existing and past clients happy. One may say that if you just started your own company, you need to go the extra mile to make your clients happy. Just a mile? No, no, no. Go 10 extra miles! You have to make it work! Promote your business and yourself shamelessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handle your finances smartly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you’re not a bookkeeper or a CPA, but having decent skills in money management is a must. If you want to succeed, you need to organize your spending properly and manage your company funds responsibly. No wasting money on a bunch of “maybes” or “what-ifs”. Think well before spending every cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Win the market, don’t just stand there!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the right set of competitive advantages over your competitors. What are the reasons for prospects to pay for your service or buy your product over your competitors? Ask yourself that question every so-often. Is your product or service cheaper? Is it better? Is your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/creating-great-customer-support/&quot;&gt;customer support&lt;/a&gt; or warranty much better than your competitors’?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put some time and effort in getting to know your clients. You will benefit from such knowledge in the time to come. Knowing who your clients are, their spending habits and other useful information could mean the difference between success or a bust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The people who make it to the top – whether they’re musicians, or great chefs, or corporate honchos – are addicted to their calling … [they] are the ones who’d be doing whatever it is they love, even if they weren’t being paid.” - Quincy Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It’s Time For a New Job</title>
   <link href="/blog/its-time-for-a-new-job/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-21T12:57:26-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/its-time-for-a-new-job</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are two types of people - the ones who are just never satisfied and happy with their current job thus changing their careers quite often and the other ones who simply fail to recognize clear signs that it’s time to change their job. The times when people would stay in one job until being retired are bygone. With the dawn of the technology era, business has changed as well as the ways businesses are handled. Consequently, job and career changes are more often than ever in the last decades despite the global economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those people that have problems seeing the signs that it’s time to change the job, then one of our questions or suggestions may help you realize the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/job-search.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/job-search-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Change Your Job&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you experiencing any kind of verbal or sexual abuse at work?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most obvious reasons for changing jobs that simply screams that you need to seek alternatives. If you are being cautious and wish to explore alternatives first, then the best idea would be to sit down and have a talk with your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/signs-you-have-a-bad-boss/&quot;&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; and/or superiors. If that doesn’t help, then it’s definitely time for a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is your boss or supervisor not taking you seriously anymore?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have started getting less and less serious assignments, that could be a sign that you are no longer taken seriously by your managers. Whatever the reason may be - personal differences, a lack of faith in your skills and competencies, or any other trivia - there is very little comfort in knowing that. Looking for another job may be the only alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is your working enthusiasm no longer on a high level?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting a career and job in a new environment, people usually get all excited about new horizons and opportunities. Over time, that enthusiasm may slightly decline. Although feeling less &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/be-happy-in-your-life-and-career/&quot;&gt;enthusiastic when going to work&lt;/a&gt; after a couple of years of working for the same company may be normal, feeling completely noxious and anxious when going to work is a bad sign. You should try to re-evaluate the reasons for feeling that way. If the job simply no longer suits your ambitions or something else has changed, then you may want to consider looking for a new job or career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you feel swamped with your job duties and often find yourself working longer hours?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a right &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/achieving-the-work-life-balance/&quot;&gt;work-life balance&lt;/a&gt; is an important aspect in our lives. While it may be feasible to sacrifice part of your free time to achieve better results or earn more money at work, in the long run, that’s not sustainable. Over time you’ll notice your results start declining progressively, even though it appears that you work more than ever. To make things even worse, if your job duties are just piling up while your pay rate remains the same, then you should probably re-consider your future with the current job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is your career affecting your physical health?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case your job requires frequent overtime hours or travels which influence your physical health, then perhaps it’s time to re-evaluate your current job. Or, maybe you are just not a morning-type person and you can’t get up every day at 5AM. Whatever the reason may be, you should take those signs seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you stagnating and not learning anything new anymore?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the time when you started working at the current position and when you had so much to learn? If you found yourself in a situation where you feel you are no longer learning anything new, and you are just simply stagnating while doing the same routine work every day without any chance for a change, then that may be one of the reasons for changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the scenarios mentioned above, there are certainly other signs more or less clear that may point your thoughts in the directions of seeking another job. In case that at least one of those questions we mentioned here made you really think about your current job, then perhaps you should start thinking about a new one even today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you’re trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I’ve had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don’t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don’t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.” – Michael Jordan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Profiling Your Customers</title>
   <link href="/blog/profiling-your-customers/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-20T10:15:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/profiling-your-customers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most important steps in running a successful business is knowing your customers. Who are they? Why do they shop your products or subscribe for your services? What are those things about your company that clients recognize as your advantage when compared to your competitors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of your business, there are different pieces of information that could be useful to know about your clients. For example, if your clients are other companies, then perhaps you should know their niche industry, the number of employees and similar details. If your clients are individuals, then other type of information may be useful, like their age, income, gender, spending habits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/customer-profiling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/customer-profiling-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Make a Customer Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gathering-information&quot;&gt;Gathering information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is certainly more than one way of gathering such information. One approach, in case you run a store, would be to simply assign a task to one or two of your employees to monitor obvious information like your shoppers’ age or gender and collect that info over the course of a couple of days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach would be to randomly pick some of your clients and ask them to complete an anonymous survey, either while shopping at your store, or by filling out an online form providing that you run an online business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have collected information, try to create a database of your clients’ profiles which would be browsable by different parameters. Organizing your current clients by age, niche industry or any other parameter would make it easier for you to target them with some new product or upgraded service. Storing this particular kind of information is an important step, so always take serious actions to protect your clients’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-value-of-collected-information&quot;&gt;The value of collected information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information you collected about your current clients will help you better understand why they shop or subscribe with you. It should help you understand why those clients chose you as opposed to your competitors and recognize the key advantages your business offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namely, the gathered information about your existing clients may help you target your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/web-marketing/&quot;&gt;marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt; for gaining more customers in the future. By knowing your targeted age group, or gender, you can make better marketing campaign choices and save a lot of money by making wise decisions and, eventually, you can gain more customers by having such targeted campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, having such data on your end can help you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/keep-your-small-business-focused/&quot;&gt;point your business to the right direction&lt;/a&gt;, the one leading you to  implementing products and services that actually come of interest to your customers’ profile structure. Instead of wasting your time and resources on trying to upgrade your services or bring new products that are of no interest to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-build-customer-loyalty/&quot;&gt;loyal clients&lt;/a&gt;, you should focus your financial and employee efforts towards requested or useful service upgrades or new valuable products. By knowing your clients well, you will save a lot of money and time and set your company to the right path of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seek-ongoing-feedback-and-repeat-the-process-of-gathering-info-on-a-recurring-basis&quot;&gt;Seek ongoing feedback and repeat the process of gathering info on a recurring basis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting information should not be a one-time activity. On the contrary, repeating this process over a longer course of time can correct smaller irregularities and present a clearer picture about your clients both to you and your team. Note that your client base can change over a longer period of time so you should definitely be prepared when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any customer profiling questions? Or perhaps you are ready to share your secrets regarding how to make a customer profile - we’d appreciate to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time for a Little T&A</title>
   <link href="/blog/time-for-a-little-ta/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-18T08:19:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/time-for-a-little-ta</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve got good news and bad news for you.  The bad news is that this post isn’t about the kind of T&amp;amp;A; you’re thinking.  The good news is that it’s EVEN BETTER: Time &amp;amp; Attendance, a crucial part of any successful retail operation.  If you’re not as excited as I am about the topic, chances are you’re what society deems a “normal person.”  And that’s good for you.  Sanity is another crucial part of any retail operation.  And this is why I’ve been asked to write this post: because my unbridled enthusiasm for T&amp;amp;A; (giggle it out now, because I’m going to use this a lot) makes me the perfect candidate to discuss the topic in a manner interesting to you, the normal person.  OK, then.  On we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/clock.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/clock-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time clock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any business is useless without its employees being there.  That’s why you hire them in the first place.  But payroll for those employees can account for up to 50% of your operating costs, which is what makes it so important to track their time very accurately.  It’s even more crucial for retail and hospitality businesses, where employees are often part time and have unpredictable schedules. Ironically, the management of your people is a job best left to— well, not people.  People, as a species, are brilliantly flawed.  And what I mean by that is despite the fact that we are prone to errors, and misinterpretation, and daydreaming about marshmallows, we can still invent tiny little machines that do all this tracking and calculating for us, much better than we ever could ourselves.  The point is that manual tracking and scheduling of your employees’ time is fraught with potential problems that will cost you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automating your T&amp;amp;A; tracking with these tiny machines—let’s call them computers—it becomes possible to run a tighter, more efficient and cost-effective ship (assuming your business is on a ship, but the same principle applies for all other locations).  Take those computers and stick them in the cloud, and you effectively extend the range of your scheduling system out to each of your employees’ homes.  This is what’s at the heart of NimbleSchedule’s online T&amp;amp;A; platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the manual alternative, and how NimbleSchedule addresses its inherent issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You need timesheets for your timesheets.  Each manual timesheet can take up to 7 minutes to review and that needs to be multiplied by the number of employees you have. What’s worse—what with human fallibility and all—those doing the reviewing don’t always get it right.  And that’s assuming the employee who filled out the timesheet got it right, too.  These errors alone account for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2003/12/22/smallb10.html&quot;&gt;1% - 7%&lt;/a&gt; of payroll costs. With NimbleSchedule’s time-clock running in parallel with your scheduling system reconciling hours scheduled vs. hours worked.  The hours needed to do this manually are eliminated and possible human error is drastically reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/workforce-scheduling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/workforce-scheduling-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Workforce scheduling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/technology-we-offer/&quot;&gt;Scheduling&lt;/a&gt; is often an act of faith.  It’s hard to keep track of who’s available and when, who wants time off; sometimes getting it right on first shot is a total crapshoot.  A good T&amp;amp;A; add-on will streamline communication by keeping all of this information in one place.  Employees can put in requests for time off or preferences for days to work and everyone has visibility to everyone else.  If an employee backs out of a shift, being able to look in one place and see who is available makes it easier for everyone.  A cloud-based T&amp;amp;A; solution makes things even easier, by adding mobile access to the time-tracking system.  With smartphone apps, your employees will be able check for and request open shifts, view the schedule wherever they are, and receive alerts reminding them of upcoming shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• With manual T&amp;amp;A;, there’s no good reporting on who’s reporting.  Again, it’s the simple difference of having all your data in one place that makes making sense of it simple.  See who your most reliable people are, and discover which ones are chronically late or tend to clock out early.  You can translate your schedule—past or future—directly into labor costs for a crystal clear picture of how each employee costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You are so over overscheduling.  Sometimes having just one too many staff on hand can be a drag on your profits.  By integrating T&amp;amp;A; with your POS, and NimbleSchedule does this with Kounta, you get a clearer picture of how much staff you actually need at any given time.  By comparing sales trends and busy hours of a time period with your labor costs, you can more properly plan and prevent overstaffing during slow times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Let’s be honest: some folks are dishonest. By and large, people are a decent sort; just don’t watch the news and then engage with the people around you.  Faith in humanity restored.  If nine out of ten of your employees are great, that still leaves you with one who can cost you money you don’t need to spend by gaming the time system.  And if you’ve got two bad apples, you run the risk of “Buddy Punching,” which is not a sequel to “Bum Fights” like it sounds.  It’s estimated that 75% of the businesses in the U.S. have employees clocking in co-workers when they’re not even there, which can account for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.m2sys.com/workforce-management/top-5-reasons-paper-time-sheets-suck-and-why-you-should-replace-them/&quot;&gt;up to 7% of payroll costs&lt;/a&gt;.  With NimbleSchedule’s mobile apps, all time punches from a smartphone are stamped with GPS data tied to a user account, so you can see if your late employee clocked in from his car on the way to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize that the year is 2015, and there probably aren’t a lot of people still using handwritten timesheets, or even old-school timeclocks.  You’ve probably gone digital in some form or another.  But you’ll notice, in the example above, how doing things from the cloud helps to streamline the automation process. If you’ve gotten rid of your multiple stacks of paper, good!  But if your people still need to be onsite to interact with your scheduling apparatus, you’re still behind the curve.  Going mobile adds greater accountability and makes the whole process more transparent.  And as part of a complete solution to help run your business, a little T&amp;amp;A; is never gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Be More Collaborative</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-be-more-collaborative/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-15T09:19:52-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-be-more-collaborative</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Demands of the modern market dictate the rules of engagement. It has become a trend that employees and management collaborate more frequently on all sorts of projects in order to meet certain standards and goals. Yet, not everyone is a good team player. If you are trying to find efficient ways of improving collaboration within your team, here are some tips and tricks you may find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/improving-collaboration.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/improving-collaboration-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Improve Collaboration in the Workplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) Understand the goals and get everyone on the same page.&lt;/em&gt; When it comes to team effort and collaborative &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/team-building-tips/&quot;&gt;team work&lt;/a&gt;, it is important that everyone pulls toward the same goal. If you have team members working on their own mini projects and each one of them has his own vision of the final goal, then your team is set for a failure. If you are a team leader, have everyone sit down and have a meeting where a joined goal or a couple of goals will be clearly defined. On the other hand, if you are only a team member just joining a project, then make sure you clearly understand the expected goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Delegate certain tasks to right people.&lt;/em&gt; Rather than trying to do everything on your own, assess the best team members to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/&quot;&gt;delegate certain tasks&lt;/a&gt; to. The essence of the collaborative work is the joined effort, hence sharing some of the duties with other team members is the right way to handle things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Set and get expectations.&lt;/em&gt; In case you are a team leader, then set clear expectations for each of your team members. If you are only a team member, then make sure you understand clearly what is expected from you. Each member of a team needs to know the scope of his work, the number of hours he needs to dedicate to a specific project and some soft or hard deadline for either the whole project or specific milestones in case the project was split into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4) If needed, write down everyone’s role.&lt;/em&gt; While clearly defining expectations for everyone is a must, sometimes even writing things down on a board for everyone to have a reminder may be a good idea. Especially if you manage or work in a large team, such a step may be necessary in order to avoid any kind of duplicate efforts or have certain parts of the work forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5) Suggest tools for better communication.&lt;/em&gt; If you work in a team with a lot of remote members, then using some cloud tools that would help you optimize your team collaborative discussion is a right thing to do. Again, if you are just a team member, do not shy away from discussions and speak up about parts of the project where you believe you could contribute with some personal effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6) Expect consensus about conflicting topics.&lt;/em&gt; Sooner or later, some of your team members will conflict about various issues or topics, especially if you work with a larger group. Ideally, all such debates should be resolved with consensus. If you are one of those who has a conflicting opinion with other team members, try to put away emotions and present facts only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7) Seek mediation for more serious issues or conflicts.&lt;/em&gt; In case you, or some other team members have serious disagreements about specific parts of the project, look for mediation. An impartial, 3rd party opinion can sometimes calm things down and get you and your team on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8) Hold productive and effective meetings.&lt;/em&gt; If involved in a large project, try to split it up into pieces and hold productive meetings for every milestone hit. Communicate directly the status of your work and everyone else’s work and determine whether or not your project is falling behind or you are right where needed regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;time effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Empathy in Business - Yes or No</title>
   <link href="/blog/empathy-in-business/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-14T14:46:01-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/empathy-in-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are witnesses of having more and more start-up companies being made just for the sake of profit. While some prosperous entrepreneurs point out that business empathy is an important part of becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/tips-for-leading-by-example/&quot;&gt;successful leader&lt;/a&gt;, it is a popular belief that some large industry players today, especially multinational corporations, lost that aspect from their sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding your employees, customers and shareholders is an important step in achieving success in business. Is there a way to achieve that without showing business empathy with all those instances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/business-career.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/business-career-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Successful Business Career&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown that companies with higher happiness rate among their employees achieve far better results and distinctly higher profits than those with the opposite situation. Cultivating a healthy organizational structure in your company will definitely require good understanding of what your employees need and want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly showing to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-fund-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;company investors and stakeholders&lt;/a&gt; that you understand their needs and desires, as well as showing that you work hard to achieve their goals and not only your personal interests and profit is a good way to have your company growing in a successful environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such clear evidence that companies with higher employee happiness and good organizational health surpass their industry competitors in all areas, we can draw a logical conclusion that empathy among business leaders is not only a desirable characteristic, but a must. Those companies that make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/social-responsibility/&quot;&gt;social responsibility&lt;/a&gt; part of their business policy are true leaders of our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is a popular belief that the modern business model promotes only competitive and ambitious people who climb over other employees and co-workers on their way to success. Unfortunately, to some extent this is true indeed. If we only take a look at the global economic crisis in the last couple of years and the decision of many large international companies which simply decided to fire part of their employees in order to maintain their profit levels, this theory appears more realistic. Yet, what were the results? Such actions have thrown almost the whole world into another economic depression, perhaps even more serious than the one from 1930’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve success in business you need to have effective workforce behind you. While intimidation and fear of job loss can sometimes be a reason for some employees to work harder, a healthy work environment and higher employee happiness prove to outperform all other scenarios. Encouraging your employees to share new ideas and explore new technologies and ways of handling some business aspects is a driven force that pushes the whole world forward. Without such progress, our whole society would stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company success depends on the empathetic leaders who can recognize the wishes and goals of others as well as their own and incorporate such goals in their companies’ every day work routine. Great leaders must be able to easily adapt to needs of others and grow on the strengths of their team, having a clear vision of everyone’s benefits as an ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Reactivating Your Inactive Subscribers</title>
   <link href="/blog/tips-for-reactivating-your-inactive-subscribers/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-13T12:11:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/tips-for-reactivating-your-inactive-subscribers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the list of active newsletter subscribers sounds as an easy task, but it’s actually not naive at all. Over time your list of subscribers will definitely grow. That’s good news. The bad news is that with an increase of subscribers and over a certain period of time your newsletter opening rate will probably drop. Maintaining the newsletter opening rate at a decent level and keeping your inactive subscribers at a minimum is an important task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newsletter-subscribers.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/newsletter-subscribers-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inactive Newsletter Subscribers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-did-some-subscribers-become-inactive&quot;&gt;Why did some subscribers become inactive?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to have some general idea about why some of your subscribers have become inactive. Aside from those reasonable arguments that some people may have changed their email address over time, while some others may have simply lost their interest in some topic, what are other reasons for seeing some of your subscribers turn into inactive ones?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Has your email become too generic looking with more or less the same content over and over again?
• Have you tried with a couple of different topics maybe, while still keeping the focus on your main industry? 
• Do you send newsletters too often?
At this point, hopefully you have a vision what might have gone wrong and you are ready to correct some of those mistakes. In case your mailing system is flexible, try separating those inactive subscribers into a separate list and do the following in order to try to re-active them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-1---reduce-the-frequency-of-your-mailing&quot;&gt;Option 1 - Reduce the frequency of your mailing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the steps to consider is to reduce the frequency of your newsletter messages. While you may have excellent emails with amazing content and an attractive offer, sending such messages too often will simply decrease the open rate by some of your subscribers and affect your campaigns on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some email providers may start labeling your emails as SPAM or JUNK in case the open rate of your subscribers significantly drops. Restoring your email deliverability after once being labeled as a JUNK sender by Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and/or other providers is a nightmare. Taking some action while it’s not too late is definitely advisable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-2--commence-the-re-activation-campaign&quot;&gt;Option 2 – Commence the re-activation campaign&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-think your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/email-marketing/&quot;&gt;email newsletter&lt;/a&gt; content well. In case you kept your focus on just one or two topics over a longer course of time, try shifting your focus a little bit and offer some variety. Steps to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Create an attractive subject line that will simply appeal to users to open your message
• Add interesting content that will justify your interesting and appealing subject line
• Monitor all clicks to links from that campaign to see if you managed to re-activate some of your subscribers
• Do not include links to social media, because this campaign if focused only on your inactive subscribers and the goal is just to re-activate them
• Include relevant pictures and testimonials about your new products and offers
• Add value to that email message and offer an optional discount and benefits in case a user clicks on any link or performs any action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you notice some activity of some of your previously inactive subscribers, do not immediately switch them back to your normal newsletter flow. Try slowly migrating them to the normal flow by maintaining another campaign with slightly different topics or pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-3--the-last-chance--an-ultimatum&quot;&gt;Option 3 – The last chance – an ultimatum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of the previously mentioned methods helped, try sending the “Last chance” – Ultimatum email to create some sense of urgency with your subscriber to re-act. Clearly format the subject line and highlight that this is the last chance for your subscriber to show some activity if they want to stay on your newsletter list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly explain benefits of your list and make it obvious for your readers what they can lose in case they decide to remain inactive or un-subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitor-results--remove-the-inactive-ones&quot;&gt;Monitor results – remove the inactive ones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have tried a couple of tips and tricks to re-activate some of your subscribers, it is time to sum up the results. Even though you may be tempted to keep your inactive subscribers on the list for the sheer numbers, as already mentioned, you should definitely avoid doing that. Keeping your subscribers list active and healthy is important, and having inactive subscribers there just to have higher numbers can only hurt your open rate and your email list reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Technology We Offer To Help You Perform Better At Work</title>

&lt;p&gt;With our cloud employee scheduling app, having an employee scheduled in two places at the same time, or at least partially overlapping, is part of the history. While trying to schedule an employee you will get a warning that your employee is already scheduled somewhere else, and then you can make a decision where you would find that employee more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;[![Employee Schedule Software&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;NimbleSchedule](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nimbleschedule-technology-thumb.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nimbleschedule-technology.jpg)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

Additionally, you can be notified about any kind of shift changes, last minute assignments or cancellations on time. If you are a manager of a team, you’ll appreciate getting notifications when your employees are late or when they request a time off. Being reminded 60 or 90 minutes before your shift starts can also be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schedule-transparency&quot;&gt;Schedule transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work in an organization where transparency is appreciated and nourished, you will really like NimbleSchedule for having an option to allow all employees to view everyone’s schedule. Of course, you can easily disable that option if that’s not needed in your company; however, in case you wish to increase scheduling transparency in your organization, we certainly have the tools to make that an easy-to-enable option.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Power of Single Sign On Solutions</title>
   <link href="/blog/the-power-of-single-sign-on-solutions/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-07T09:46:48-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/the-power-of-single-sign-on-solutions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How great would it be if you could login to all systems you use online with the same username and password combination? If you work in an environment where various online SaaS tools are used, then we are ready to bet that you frequently struggle with some of those systems while you are trying to remember your login details for at least some of them. This is where the concept of Single Sign On roles in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-concept&quot;&gt;The Concept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you and your colleagues or employees use different cloud systems for various aspects of your business, then it is important to have all those tools listed in one place with an easy and fast way to login to each of those portals. Ideally, with one click of a mouse! Is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Single Sign On concept allows companies to maintain their employee accounts through a single interface allowing everyone to easily manage access details across various systems. Every person that works in companies where multiple tools are used for different aspects of company needs is aware how valuable such concept is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/single-sign-on.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/single-sign-on-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Single Sign On&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an SSO provider for your company needs is not so complicated as it sounds. There are various providers that support this concept and we will definitely take this opportunity to recommend one of our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no longer a need to remember 247 different login parameters for each of the systems you use on a daily or occasional basis. The same frustration is shared by all your colleagues and employees as well. The solution of having a unified panel from which you could allow your employees to simply click on the app you assign to them and login with just that single click of a mouse is a perfect solution. And it’s definitely not a science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-login&quot;&gt;One Login&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onelogin.com/&quot;&gt;OneLogin&lt;/a&gt; offers an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution for companies of any size or industry that allows you to organize all those cloud and on-premise apps that you and your employees use into a single portal thus making your work day much more efficient and much less frustrating and time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a secure interface, with only one set of login credentials, your employees can start using all important applications required for their everyday work and obligations - OneLogin takes care of signing into all your applications directly. This concept will increase your employee efficiency and productivity, reduce stress and shorten the time for each of your employees to login to any and every app they need to use during their work hours. And all this is done more securely than with traditional passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose through a myriad of different apps, simply assign them to your application catalog and automatically provision them to your employees. Adding a new app for your employees is very easy, and they will appreciate such a time saving solution through which they can login anywhere, with a single click of their mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actively work on your professional relationships&lt;/em&gt;. As in your personal life, professional relationships need to be nourished. Be proactive and maintain harmonic relation with your peers. Be a trustworthy partner that your peers can rely upon. Do not gossip around, as such actions carry a risk of running your reputation and reliability if such rumors get into wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be a good listener&lt;/em&gt;. If you wish to move you ranking higher in your company, you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/being-a-good-listener/&quot;&gt;be a good listener&lt;/a&gt;. No matter if you are talking to the company owner, or the cleaning lady, everyone likes to be heard when they have something to say. Always take into consideration what your co-workers said or suggested. Listen to their arguments, and do not hesitate to mention their names on the company meetings if their suggestions turned out to be valid and true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-assess your work ethics occasionally&lt;/em&gt;. Even if you are a manager or the company owner, being perceived as a fair and ethical person can be a huge plus in your interpersonal relations. Exercise ethical behavior and re-assess your integrity and impact of your words and decisions on your co-workers or employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work on your communication skills&lt;/em&gt;. Be careful when wording certain things, especially on company meetings. The last thing you’ll want to do is to imply that someone is not doing his job well by just not choosing the words carefully or not thinking enough. If you are asked on the meetings to present some material, try to be concise and straight to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be a problem solver&lt;/em&gt;. While nosing around is probably a bad habit, presenting yourself in some cases as a problem solver can be of a big reputation benefit. There’s a fine line between those two things so you’ll have to use your best judgment to determine when to get involved into some matters and try to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/problem-solving-techniques/&quot;&gt;present yourself as a problem solver&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a manager, and two of your employees disagree too often, try to settle down such disputes between two of them before they bring down the whole office in such a mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the tips we have singled out for you as they proved to be the most efficient ones. If you have some thoughts on how to improve interpersonal skills, we would be glad to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Want to be a project manager? Check this out</title>
   <link href="/blog/want-to-be-a-project-manager/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-28T11:04:35-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/want-to-be-a-project-manager</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As with any other career, being a project manager includes a whole set of challenges you will need to overcome in order to become a successful professional in this area. From being a natural problem solver to understanding clients’ needs as well as assessing professional skills of your team members, these are all the qualities that will significantly help you in your PM career. As with any other aspect in business, or even generally in life, only a minor part of success is talent, and probably 80-90% of success is hard work. With that being said, there are certainly things you can learn and improve to be good in this profession. Here are some of the important things you should know about being a project manager and some tips that may help you excel in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/project-manager.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/project-manager-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Become a Project Manager&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-and-write--nail-down-all-details-and-requirements&quot;&gt;Listen and write – Nail down all details and requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t learn if you don’t listen. When starting a new project you need to listen to your clients or whomever is setting the goals for the new project. Pay attention to desires and goals that need to be achieved. Write down all the details you hear through those initial conversations and meetings and be prepared to evaluate requirements. Certain details can affect timelines or budget for the project completion so it is important to have a clear vision of goals and requirements at the very beginning.  Do not hesitate to ask questions and poke around for more details. If you get a feeling that too many questions in one session may be slightly overwhelming for clients, then schedule another session for certain details. Do not leave room for any uncertainties, as such may create a gap between what client is expecting as the end result, and what you actually deliver. Details are of utmost importance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identify-team-requirements&quot;&gt;Identify team requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After gathering all the project requirements from either clients or team executives, it is time to assess your team members with best skills needed for that specific project. Having people with right skills, doing right parts of the project will make a difference between success and failure. Hence, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/team-building-tips/&quot;&gt;knowing your team&lt;/a&gt; well and what each of your team members is good at is of a huge importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-the-project-milestones&quot;&gt;Set the project milestones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to eat the whole orange in a single bite will probably cause you to choke on it. However, if you slice it down a little bit, and eat piece by piece, things will go much smoother. This common knowledge can and should be applied to projects as well. Define important milestones and slice down bigger projects into pieces. Use those mini goals as break points in your whole project to consult with your whole team and with the client to make sure that you are on the right path.  Such moments can be important to determine any possible pain-points and slightly re-adjust the process or the final goal, if needed. Such breakpoints will also help you stay on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;time-frame for completion&lt;/a&gt; as well as improve the cost control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anticipate-issues-and-be-ready-to-solve-them&quot;&gt;Anticipate issues and be ready to solve them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running any kind of a bigger project management operation and hoping that everything will go smooth without any issues along the way might be a bit naïve. While it may happen you’ll be lucky enough and have no major setbacks or issues, relaying just on luck may not be the best idea. Being aware of any potential risks and being well prepared to react in such situations is a smart thing to do. Having an ace in your sleeve in case any issues arise might help you resolve such problems much faster and prove to your team that you are not a good project manager by luck, but for a reason. Staying within predicted timeframe for the project completion might depend on how fast you can resolve certain issues along the way. Are you a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/problem-solving-techniques/&quot;&gt;good problem solver&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quality-control-test-test-and-then-test-some-more&quot;&gt;Quality control: test, test and then test some more&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still working on your project, make sure that all deliverables are being properly tested. You do not need to wait for the whole project to end to do that. As a matter of fact, you shouldn’t wait for the whole project to end to test everything. While the project is still being worked on, do some testing and quality control on all those things that can be realistically tested at each phase of your project. Detecting certain issues on time might help your team stay on track and adjust later project phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-from-your-experience&quot;&gt;Learn from your experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use every project to learn about your procedures and measures. Learn from mistakes, and use every project to assess your personal and your team’s weaknesses. Such experience will help you be better prepared for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Challenges Managers Face</title>
   <link href="/blog/challenges-managers-face/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-27T11:05:42-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/challenges-managers-face</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being a manager has its advantages but it has also many day-to-day challenges that good and efficient managers need to overcome. Some of those managers’ challenges relate to daily operations, while others have deeper roots in the human nature and interpersonal relationships. With an idea to point out some of those challenges, our goal is also to help out those who experience certain challenging situations in their everyday activities so they could overcome such challenges in the best and easiest possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/managers-challenges.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/managers-challenges-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Manager Responsibilities&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Getting your team motivated.&lt;/strong&gt; This is probably one of the most important challenges every manager faces on a daily basis. Managing a highly motivated team to perform best at their duties is a must. Yet, it is easier said than done. With every day manager responsibilities and issues in personal lives, it is hard to keep the team spirit high at all times. Knowing your team members well is key for success here. With a clear vision on what motivates each of your employees and how to get them up and running is valuable information that every good manager should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Coaching and mentoring your team.&lt;/strong&gt; It is easy to get lost in everyday manager responsibilities and duties and one can fail to pay enough attention to the team needs. Yet, as a team leader, it is the manager’s duty to coach the team properly and mentor them on every step of the process. Finding some free time on a recurring basis to dedicate to each team member is an important aspect of the successful team management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Keeping up with the industry trends and technology.&lt;/strong&gt; It is important that the manager stays in the loop with the latest industry and technology trends. The manager is the team leader and should never allow himself to fall behind the trends and activities on the market. This does not necessarily mean that the manager should be an expert in all aspects of his business; however, some general overall knowledge of such trends is more than desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Rewarding productive employees for their good results and hard work.&lt;/strong&gt; The process of rewarding your best employees does not necessarily need to include money and bonuses. A well put circular email sent to your employees, clearly mentioning the best ones on the current project should suffice. Similarly, pointing out the employees with the best results on the next company’s meeting would do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Balancing between all sides in the company.&lt;/strong&gt; Too many managers make a mistake of being too close with all employees by trying to show themselves as “one of the team”. Yet, by doing so, they sometimes lose part of the influence on some of the team members, and risk being perceived as non-manager’s material by higher company executives. On the other hand, by becoming too close with the executives or company owners, managers risk being perceived as a not-care-enough-for-employees type of  leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of most common managers’ challenges, the ones they experience on a daily basis while trying to pull the maximum out of their team. If you have any tips or tricks to share with us which might fit well as an extension of this list, please contact us and share your experience with us. We would love to hear more from our visitors!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Keep Your Small Business Focused</title>
   <link href="/blog/keep-your-small-business-focused/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-22T09:48:01-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/keep-your-small-business-focused</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leading a small new company to the path of success is one challenging process, with obstacles on almost every step along the way. Yet, running a small company is different from running medium or large firms in so many ways. Trying to create your place on the market could often times lead you to try new things and it could easily happen that your small company loses its previously defined focus. Here are some tips on how to keep your small business focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/business-objectives.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/business-objectives-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Business Objectives&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;develop-your-companys-mission&quot;&gt;Develop Your Company’s Mission&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a good plan with strategic decisions about your company’s work and development is an excellent idea. On the other hand, surviving day by day and wandering through the business world without a clear vision should be avoided. A much better solution is to have a good business plan with a strategic mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-your-niche-industry-trends&quot;&gt;Follow Your Niche Industry Trends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your company to succeed in business, then you have to follow trends. Just working while having your head buried in the sand is a very bad idea. Industries tend to change whereas various tools or trends occasionally bring certain changes to various industries. Hence, staying in the loop is a must. Depending on the exact industry, ways to follow such trends may vary, so subscribing to certain magazines or blogs that are relevant to your niche industry should come handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-loyal-and-efficient-employee-team&quot;&gt;Create a loyal and efficient employee team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/team-building-tips/&quot;&gt;excellent employee team&lt;/a&gt; behind yourself helping you achieve your company’s goals is an important factor if you want to succeed. Well oiled teams do not just simply fall from the sky, so you’ll have to dedicate some time to finding the right members and then organizing them in the best possible way. Being a good manager is just one of the parameters that will lead your company to success. Another one is to have an excelling group of employees working along your side toward such a goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stick-to-your-strategic-plans-and-missions&quot;&gt;Stick to Your Strategic Plans and Missions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many things going on around you, and the abundance of new technologies emerging every day, especially when working online, it is hard to stay focused and to keep your important mission as the primary goal. Taking new projects along the way could very easily make you lose your primary mission from your focus and waste too much time working on some other goals, which simply will not result in hitting your main mission goal at the end of the story. So, when such opportunities arise, you should ask yourself whether or not such new projects, tools or tasks are in sync with your small business objectives and should you chase such other things or stay focused on what’s more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analyze-results&quot;&gt;Analyze results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define some periods that might be good to re-analyze your company’s results. Whether that’s on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, analyzing your results will help you stay focused and have a clear vision about your current success. What are those areas that are currently bringing excellent results and what are those that can be improved? Trying to fix something that’s not broken might actually break some things. Knowing where exactly the pain points preventing you from achieving even better results are is a prerequisite for pushing your success bar even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-your-loyal-customers&quot;&gt;Listen to your loyal customers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing your current client base with an opportunity to state their opinion and provide some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent idea to revise your procedures and help you stay focused on your small business objectives. With such results in mind, you’ll have a better vision whether you need to invest more time and money in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/creating-great-customer-support/&quot;&gt;customer support&lt;/a&gt;, focus more on marketing, or invest more resources in improving your products or services.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Creating Emails Worth Opening</title>
   <link href="/blog/creating-emails-worth-opening/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-21T11:15:55-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/creating-emails-worth-opening</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you decided to check the power of email marketing, then you probably already have a vision of the information you would like to serve to your subscribers. Creating the right type of emails to grab the interest of your audience and force them to interact and open your emails is a whole different story. With that being said, here are some tips that might help you get more out of your subscribers’ base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/emails-worth-opening.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/emails-worth-opening-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How To Write An Email&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content is king&lt;/em&gt;. Think well about what kind of information you would like to relay through your email subscriber base. Is that content already available on your website? And if so, then why should the reader even open your emails? Try to use the email communication with your subscribers to notify them about some important stuff, or provide them with some neat tips and tricks about their interests. Do not just copy/paste the information from your website. That content can be seen whenever they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write appealing subject lines&lt;/em&gt;. This tip might be one of the most important ones so make sure to learn how to write an email subject. Always have in mind that most of your subscribers might even delete your email without even taking a look at its content if there is no subject line.  As for the email subject length, it should be fairly short and relevant to the content. Moreover, it should intrigue your subscriber enough to click on and open it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place relevant images in your email newsletter&lt;/em&gt;. People process and remember images much better than a plain text. While you should be careful not to go overboard with too many images, and risk even your emails being labeled as junk or spam by some strict spam systems, well placed 2-3 images per email message should do the trick and make your emails look much more appealing to your readership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make your emails worthwhile reading&lt;/em&gt;. As mentioned before in one of our articles about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/email-marketing/&quot;&gt;email marketing&lt;/a&gt;, your email messages need to deliver some value to your subscribers on a regular basis. By getting your audience used to getting something out of your emails, a small discount coupon code, or an announcement of new products, your future email opening rate is guaranteed to rise. Consider it a small reward to the subscriber for reading your email message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add user generated testimonials, if available&lt;/em&gt;. If you have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter page, or some other place on the web where users leave honest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;reviews about your business&lt;/a&gt; or products, then use some of those reviews and include them in your email messages occasionally. People genuinely like reading honest reviews made by other customers. Reading user generated testimonials is quite frequently one of the first steps that certain prospects do prior to engaging into business with start-up companies, like yours might be. So if you have such a content, make sure to include it from time to time in your newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask your subscribers for feedback&lt;/em&gt;. Generally, a lot of people like to state their opinion about various things. So why not occasionally allowing your subscribers to fill in a survey and get their opinion about your product or services, even about the content of your future email messages? While some people will not use the chance to provide their feedback, most of them will appreciate the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Excelling at Work</title>
   <link href="/blog/tips-for-excelling-at-work/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-20T10:27:23-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/tips-for-excelling-at-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No matter if your job is in the first, or last place of top 5 important things in your life, having a successful career is for sure one of the most desired goals you want to reach. In case you sometimes struggle with the question of how to increase work productivity, we have prepared some useful tips that might help you excel in your career and do better at your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/success-at-work.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/success-at-work-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How To Increase Work Productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess your work results as objective as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a clear idea about your job performance is the first step in excelling at work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/signs-of-a-workaholic/&quot;&gt;Becoming a workaholic&lt;/a&gt; is probably something that should be avoided. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/achieving-the-work-life-balance/&quot;&gt;right balance in your career and personal life&lt;/a&gt; is a key for happiness, so achieving the state of equilibrium is a must. Once you have the right amount of time dedicated to your work, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-productivity/&quot;&gt;improving productivity&lt;/a&gt; and being effective is a whole new topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act professionally while working.&lt;/strong&gt; No matter what type of job you do, acting professionally is something that is expected from you. There is time for fun and jokes, but when the time comes for work, fooling around should stop. Dressing up appropriately for your work environment is part of being a professional as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show a positive attitude.&lt;/strong&gt; By no means you should be that quiet guy that agrees with everyone and just nods approval to whatever he hears. Demonstrating some professional integrity is a must from time to time. However, when there are work efforts made by others that you disagree with, showing a positive attitude and a good team spirit is even more preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a good team player.&lt;/strong&gt; Be aware of your bad temper, in case you have one, and work on toning it down while working in a team. You can be the best employee in the world but if you just keep clashing and arguing with other team members, your contribution to the team might come in jeopardy. Work on your interpersonal skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not focus on promotion only.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if that’s your ultimate goal, focus on your productivity and results first. Work on your habits and improve your expertise. Working better and harder will ultimately lead to the promotion anyway, but don’t just be that guy in the office that keeps chasing promotions only. Your colleagues will notice that, and will appreciate you less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand out!&lt;/strong&gt; Show yourself as indispensable in your company by the quality of your results and the speed of your work. Don’t just stand out by being the loudest guy in the office. Make your everyday work results speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand your boss / employer.&lt;/strong&gt; Be aware of his goals and work routines. Try to understand him better when he makes a request and analyze his attitude towards your colleagues.  What are those qualities that your employer likes and respects? Could you sometimes anticipate some of the requests coming at your direction from your boss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not be part of a problem, be part of a solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid conflicting situations with other team members even if there is someone annoying you SO much that you just can’t stand working with him. Do not engage into arguing with such people too often, although sometimes you probably need to demonstrate your integrity. Show yourself as part of a solution and money making team for your boss. He will love you for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While excelling at work is not all about impressing your employer or getting a promotion, at the end of the day, by excelling at work you will achieve those goals as well. What is probably the most important part of such an achievement is that you will feel better about yourself by constantly learning and striving to be better at what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember a famous quote made by Vincent Lombardy: &lt;em&gt;“The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Reach Your Goals</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-reach-your-goals/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-15T10:35:08-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-reach-your-goals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all desire different things in our lives. Yet, getting the motivation and self-discipline to reach those goals is the hard part. While some people struggle to find proper ways to achieve their goals, others have a lot more success by applying diverse &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;time management techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us share with you some tips on how to reach your goals in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine your weaknesses.&lt;/strong&gt; Depending on the type of your goal, this process might involve different steps. Nonetheless, it is very important to acknowledge your weaknesses on time and figure out the steps to minimize their influence. Setting yourself on the path of improving and coping with those weaknesses is a must in order to achieve success in your life, no matter if your goals are work or non-work related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Believe in yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; This is probably the most important step of all. Work on yourself, and do not let minor obstructions discourage you. Be prepared for some failures or problems along the way, but do not let those things shake your confidence. If you do not believe in yourself, why others should?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/achieve-your-goals.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/achieve-your-goals-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reach Your Goals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set realistic goals.&lt;/strong&gt; If you set the bar too high for yourself, you might be setting yourself for a failure. While indeed it is important to set your bar high enough to challenge yourself to work even harder and learn even more, setting it too high is definitely counter-productive. With unreachable goals you will just waste your time and set yourself for a chain of failures and disappointment. Hence, it is of utmost importance to be realistic with your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about the right plan.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a reason why on all military academies people learn various strategies and tactics for winning wars. Having the right plan and the right strategy is a difference between success and failure. If you believe that everything in life relies just on luck, then you can try your chances. A wise man would build up a good plan, write it down, and think about the best strategy to start working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split up high goals into smaller pieces.&lt;/strong&gt; If your goal requires a lot of work and might take too much time, which could cause you to lose a clear vision of your end line or lose some confidence because it takes too long to achieve it, then the best idea is to divide your large goal into smaller chunks. Taking the smaller steps might prove better for your confidence and provide instant results that are measurable. At least, you will know that you are on the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be ready for obstacles.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing in life probably goes that smooth and some obstacles are to be expected. Be ready for them, and try to predict some of the issues even before they occur. Having some answers for potential problems already prepared might save you a lot of time down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize your goal; stay positive and stay focused!&lt;/strong&gt; Going through life with half done things or having million projects and dreams half way done is a bad scenario. Whenever you feel down, you need to visualize your goal and remind yourself one more time what you are exactly trying to achieve. Imagine that you already made that goal. How does that feel? Stay focused! You have to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Leading by Example</title>
   <link href="/blog/tips-for-leading-by-example/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-14T11:47:57-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/tips-for-leading-by-example</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Often times we heard our co-workers saying that famous sentence &lt;em&gt;“If I were running things here, I would do them better”&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, being a boss and a leader has its own challenges. While people like to see their boss getting his own hands dirty and getting down to trenches with his people, such leadership may not lead to the best results. When a boss starts spending too much time with his employees shoulder to shoulder, who will run the business and supervise the execution of business plans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you lead a team of employees, there is a chance that you are a natural born leader. However, in the majority of cases, becoming an exemplary team leader is a process in which one needs to be well trained in the first place and later on, continuous improvement is needed. Here are some tips and tricks on how to lead your employees by example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lead-by-example.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lead-by-example-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leading by Example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establish-yourself-as-a-person-with-integrity&quot;&gt;Establish yourself as a person with integrity.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be open for your employees’ suggestions and opinions and demonstrate honesty at every step you do. It is easy to pick your favorites in your team, but being fair is of utter importance. When your employee does the things right, do not spare words to compliment him instead of nitpicking about every little detail you didn’t like. Sure, suggest some changes along the way that you would do differently, but if the overall result was good, then clearly state so. If your favorite employees messed something up, then be fair and provide some criticism instantly. Do not let them slide with the mistake and let others see that you have favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-what-you-are-talking&quot;&gt;Know what you are talking.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team leader you certainly cannot be an expert for every area of your product or service; nevertheless, try to learn as much as possible about your industry niche. By showing some knowledge in that area, you will gain respect of your employees. Again, you are not expected to know every little thing about your product, but without some general knowledge about procedures and technologies, how could you effectively supervise your team or department?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-your-employees-and-be-there-for-them&quot;&gt;Listen to your employees and be there for them.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when you have a lot of work on your end, as a good leader, you always need to find time to see how your team is doing and if they are facing some problems that need your attention. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/being-a-good-listener/&quot;&gt;Being a good listener&lt;/a&gt; is a must for a good team leader. Listening to what your employees have to say may prevent some conflicts in the future that could be simply avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;face-the-issues-and-conflicting-team-members-directly&quot;&gt;Face the issues and conflicting team members directly.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing worse for the team spirit if they notice that their leader is running away from some issues or problems. Therefore, try to face such issues immediately upon their occurrence. If you cannot resolve every issue, then think about hiring some help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to conflicting members of your team that always seem to fall into some arguments with others, such behaviors need to be addressed straightaway. Although constructive criticism is always welcome, having a person that keeps opposing to every proposal and obstructing any plan is a terrible situation that might build up a lot of frustration and anxiety among your employees. Address such people and their problems effectively and on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;value-your-employees-and-nourish-the-relationship-with-them&quot;&gt;Value your employees and nourish the relationship with them.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you are a big boss, and you make strategic decisions that could affect your company’s future and everyone’s jobs, find some time to nurture the relationship with your employees and co-workers. If your type of work is very time-consuming, then try scheduling a company party or gathering of your employees at least once in a couple of months. Interpersonal bonds with your employees can only make your team stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What To Do After Being Laid Off</title>
   <link href="/blog/what-to-do-after-being-laid-off/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-13T08:24:07-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/what-to-do-after-being-laid-off</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whether there is an economic crisis or not, employees get laid off from their companies from time to time. Most people had such a situation at least once in their professional career. If that happened to you, do not despair and do not go into a panic mode. Here are some basic steps on what to do when laid off from work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not broadcast the message to everyone.&lt;/em&gt;
Although you may get an instinctive reaction to start broadcasting that message by complaining to your family and friends, that might not be the best idea. Some of your friends might have good work related contacts that could be helpful along the way in trying to find another job later on. Hence, do not broadcast the wrong message straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not panic.&lt;/em&gt;
Ok, so you have lost your job? Do not panic! Give yourself a moment to absorb everything that happened and take care of your emotions first. You do not want to start reading job ads immediately and applying to any job post that you notice. Take some time to think about your accomplishments in your work history and think well about your next moves. Statistics show that not that many employers find workers through job ads as you would expect. So organize yourself well, think about what you want to do, and make a plan for seeking a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bridge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bridge-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How To Cope With Being Laid Off&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not burn bridges behind you.&lt;/em&gt;
Try to leave the company gracefully, even though you might be tempted to give them a piece of your mind. Burning bridges behind you is never a good idea. Leave the room for some possible future cooperation and try to give a positive tone to everything, as much as possible, of course. Try to stay in best possible relations with your ex employer or manager as they might need you again at some point in the future. This does not mean you should sit and wait for them to call you after 7 days, but do not neglect that possibility at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimize your spending right away.&lt;/em&gt;
If you had some vacation already planned and perhaps deposited some cash, see if you can cancel it and take the cash back. Pulling the money from your retirement fund is probably a bad idea, unless there are no alternatives. So think well about your financial situation and based on that determine some comfortable deadline for seeking a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ask yourself if this is the right time for a career change.&lt;/em&gt;
If this is the second or third job you have lost lately, then take some time to evaluate if you are in the right business. Write down your biggest accomplishments and select carefully the things that make you feel good while doing them. This information might help you to properly set your career goals. In case your financial situation is solid, try some career coaching sessions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start your job seeking campaign with a positive spirit.&lt;/em&gt;
If you already have a LinkedIn profile, then update your status accordingly letting your work contacts that you are in the market for a job. Even if you use other social media networks such as Twitter or Facebook, then update your work status and see if your friends or contacts have some ideas or recommendations. Employers love hiring new staff recommended by their trustful employees. With that being said, getting a recommendation from a business contact or a friend of a friend might be an excellent way to find a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the positive spirit up.&lt;/em&gt;
While losing a job is indeed an unfortunate event and can cause a lot of stress, try to keep the positive spirit. If you don’t take up some sport, then start doing some exercises or at least some running sessions with a friend or a family member. Keeping your body in a good physical shape will make your mind feel much better, which is just one of many efficient ways how to cope with being laid off.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Drag-and-Drop Employee Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/drag-and-drop-employee-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-12T10:03:16-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/drag-and-drop-employee-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the software world there is always a procedure to get certain tasks done. That procedure usually includes a series of actions that consist of a lot of clicks across various screens, pages or options. The situation is the same in the cloud software world, especially when it comes to workforce solutions. If you are in charge of making employee schedules, then you are probably already aware of the longevity and complexity of such a process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our engineers and UI experts recognized a need to build useful shortcuts for the scheduling process that would save you time and get the work done with less stress. One of them is certainly the drag-and-drop feature which has shown excellent results. What used to be a tedious and time-consuming task can now be done in seconds. Namely, the only thing you need to do is simply pick up a shift with your mouse and drag it to a proper schedule slot. How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scheduler-Drag-And-Drop.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Scheduler-Drag-And-Drop-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scheduler Drag-and-Drop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reorganizing parts of the shifts on the schedule now takes significantly less time with this option. Instead of wasting a lot of time on clicking on a specific shift, waiting for an edit dialog to show up and then erasing the name of an existing employee assigned to that shift and selecting a different employee, now you can just simply click on a shift, and drag it wherever you want. You can drag it across different days or different employees - the choice is yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the employee to whom you wish to re-assign a shift needs to have the proper position/skill on his/her profile. If that condition is met, then there is nothing else you need to worry about. On the other hand, if you are simply moving a shift for the same employee from one day in a week to another, then that’s even easier. You just click on the shift with your mouse and you drag it into the slot for another day where you can “drop” it. As soon as you perform these actions, the employee that gets assigned to the shift receives a notification that a new shift has been added to his schedule. Similarly, the employee whose shift has been removed and allocated to someone else receives a notification about the removed shift as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing you workforce members is much easier now than ever. If you are already a NimbleSchedule client, make sure you follow our blog for the latest improvements and news so you can utilize the full power of our schedule maker. In case you are still not our client, feel free to try out our 14-day free trial and improve your employee scheduling process as well as your workforce management.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quick NimbleSchedule Tips & Tricks</title>
   <link href="/blog/quick-nimbleschedule-tips-and-tricks/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-07T23:39:01-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/quick-nimbleschedule-tips-and-tricks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Employee time management software like NimbleSchedule is the right tool to have if you want to organize your staff members efficiently and cut down expenses significantly. Tracking the productivity of your employees through various reports in NimbleSchedule is a piece of cake, and knowing the exact time when your employees started and ended working can save your company quite a decent amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in one of our previous articles (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/mobile-scheduling-survey/&quot;&gt;A Survey on Mobile Scheduling&lt;/a&gt;), shift scheduling software like NimbleSchedule can secure the right number of employees doing their job on a daily basis for your company, as well as cut down on no-show cases by enabling your employees to know their shifts and schedule at any time of the day or night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will focus on some handy tips and tricks you might find useful when using NimbleSchedule on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-the-start-day-of-the-week&quot;&gt;1) Changing the start day of the week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various companies have various scheduling rules and ways of handling their employee’ schedules. One of the frequent questions coming from our customers is how to change the start day of the weekly schedule in order to accommodate the previous habits your employees or schedulers had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DayOfTheWeekToStartSchedule.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DayOfTheWeekToStartSchedule-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling - Change the Start Day of the Week&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By navigating to the Settings section and the “Schedules” sub-option, you should be able to find the “Day of the week to begin schedule” option on top of that page. By adjusting that drop down menu to a proper day, and saving the setting, your weekly schedule will be adjusted to start with any day you selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limiting-employee-clock-in-locations-to-authorized-locations-only&quot;&gt;2) Limiting employee clock in locations to authorized locations only&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most companies probably want to allow employees to check their schedule from home and exchange messages, or do other stuff through the system, restricting your employees from clocking in from home or other places is actually something that companies usually want to implement. This is where the “Clock Locations” option in NimbleSchedule comes very handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ClockLocations.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ClockLocations-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling - Authorized Clock Locations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using this option, you can easily restrict your employees to be able to clock in and out only from your office computers. By specifying your network IP range (or even a fixed IP address), you can manage authorized time clock locations for your employees in quite an easy manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to setting these clock locations in the system, make sure you have enabled the “Only allow employees to clock-in from authorized locations” option on the “Time Clocking” page under the “Settings” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scheduling-20-employees-for-the-same-time-and-for-the-full-month-under-20-seconds&quot;&gt;3) Scheduling 20 employees for the same time and for the full month under 20 seconds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more work and less time for the scheduling process, managers quite frequently struggle to complete their scheduling assignments on time. Even when the schedule is quite simple, and it repeats more or less, it still takes time for schedulers and managers to write everything down and assign everyone with a proper shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through NimbleSchedule, this process is as simple as ABC, and you can finish scheduling tasks in under 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CreateShifts.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CreateShifts-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Scheduling - Advanced Create Shifts Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By opening the “Create Shifts” dialog above the schedule, you will gain access to one of our powerful scheduling tools. The first thing you need to do is to select a proper position as well as the start and end time of the shift. Then, you select the days of the week when that shift needs to occur, in this case Monday through Friday. After that, you select the “Repeat” option and, for the sake of this tutorial, we chose to repeat this schedule for the whole month of April, 2015. The last step is to select employees on the right you wish to assign with this set of shifts. We selected 20 employees there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you complete this couple of easy steps, you are ready to hit either the “Save” or “Publish” button. By following this procedure, we just created 400 shifts in less than 20 seconds. What a time saver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quickly-finding-scheduled-or-not-scheduled-employees-by-department-or-position&quot;&gt;4) Quickly finding scheduled or not scheduled employees, by department or position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, at NimbleSchedule, realize how time-consuming the scheduling process can be without proper tools and filters for a better team overview. This is why we invested a lot of thoughts and work in developing various filters with which you can see a clear overview of your specific departments and positions and spot in seconds who was left behind unscheduled or who are the ones that are scheduled for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ScheduleFilters.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ScheduleFilters-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Scheduling - Advanced Schedule Filters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By selecting the proper position or department in the drop down menus above the schedule, you can see all your employees that belong to the selected parameter. Additionally, by combining those fields, with the “Filter” menu options above the schedule on the left, you can see only scheduled or only unscheduled employees from certain positions or departments in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saving-only-one-or-two-days-as-a-template-instead-of-a-whole-week&quot;&gt;5) Saving only one or two days as a template instead of a whole week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manage a large team of employees and have specific days when you wish to repeat the same schedule, reading all the shifts from one day, and then creating the exact replicate on some other date might be extremely time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the template system we offer, by default, you save a week or a full month of the schedule, but how about one day or 2-3 days only?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/TemplateTricks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/TemplateTricks-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Scheduling - Saving a Schedule Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By manually adjusting the date range on the “Save as template” dialog, you can force the system to save just one, two, or custom range of days. Applying such a template is quite easy later on since you can specify the exact date when to start applying a template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could continue naming all the tiny tips and tricks for the whole day, and each could save you a lot of time, especially if you use NimbleSchedule on a daily basis. But these are just some universal ones that many companies might find very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue the series of similar articles in the future, presenting some of the time saver techniques of our shift scheduling software. Until then, stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Get Great Reviews for Your Small Business</title>
   <link href="/blog/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-04T09:16:34-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having a great product or an excellent service is not a guarantee that your business will survive in today’s economy. Many companies now invest a lot of money in branding and advertising, yet, as we explained in one of our past articles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/the-word-of-mouth/&quot;&gt;the word of mouth&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best and most efficient ways to put out the word about your business. An excellent mix of all those methods are actually reviews which you can obtain from your existing or past clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reviews.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reviews-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Small Business Reviews&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many companies invest in their social media or other advertising campaigns, not all of them have a way for their customers to leave a public review about their business. When it comes to online business, it is not a rare occasion that prospects will first use a search engine to find honest and independent small business reviews about some website or service on the third party network prior to engaging with that business. This is especially the case when it comes to small companies and relatively new online firms. With that being said, it appears extremely important to have a set of loyal customers that will write an honest review about your business on the third party websites and networks, allowing potential prospects to read the comments about your company. Yet, how the question is how to get business reviews?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, you must get your product or service in the best possible order. If that includes your extended work hours to supervise your employees and their communication with prospects and clients, then so be it. Each step in the process should be properly taken and every feedback from a client or prospect should be addressed in an appropriate manner. Once you ensure that that your product or service is at a satisfying level, then you can start thinking about ways to utilize positive feedback you got from your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your support team assists your existing clients and  provides answers to your prospects via any online method, then you should be able to provide a link for them to write a review about your service. For example, you can ask your clients to provide honest feedback about your service via your internal system, or by using some third party review app or network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expecting that your happy customers will seek review websites where they could say a couple of nice words about your business is unrealistic. Yet, if you provide them with an easy way to do that, for instance by posting an embedded link in the email footer which would lead them to a form where they could leave their positive feedback, a lot of your clients might do it. That way, not only will you get real  customer testimonials for other online visitors to see but also valuable feedback about the ways you handle your business so you can act on every reasonable criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By ensuring that your product or service is highly competitive with other offers out there, and by providing the best possible customer support (via phone, chat, ticket, email or any other means of communication), you are on the right path to get business reviews worth showing off. In addition, by providing links either on your website or in your emails to leading to your social media channels or third party review websites, you will help your customers focus their reviews on the channels where you believe others might read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you get a slightly bad review, do not try to hide it; on the contrary, address it professionally. If an apology is needed, then do not hesitate to apologize to the client, go the extra mile to make that person happy. Once you ensure that you have a happy client on that end, ask him to review his previous negative feedback, thus you will create a win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Beat the Monday Blues</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-beat-the-monday-blues/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-03T08:55:52-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-beat-the-monday-blues</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it’s Monday morning and you are about to go to work. One more eventful weekend is over and you are contemplating on how to beat the Monday blues. If you were smart and lucky enough, you used the opportunity to relax from work and you spent some quality time with your friends or family. If you are more of a loner, you probably watched TV, ordered some pizza or played a game or two on your computer. Alas, that lovely weekend is completely over now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a workaholic, then Monday morning is probably a great time for you. A new work week is starting and here comes your new chance to prove yourself at work. Your ironed suit and polished shoes are probably already waiting for you along with the reports meticulously packed in your briefcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the world, well, it seems they need a small kick-start at the beginning of the week. A big cup of coffee and some nice music on the way to work might do the trick. For those that need a bit of more of an inspiration here is one amazing motivational video to set your mood for the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As H. Jackson Brown, Jr once said: &lt;em&gt;“Find a job you like and you will add five days to every week”&lt;/em&gt;. So the question is, do you have a job you like? If the answer is “Yes”, then you are a lucky person. Not everyone has that luck to do what they love. But even then, it is nice to remind yourself of the things you have and the goals you have set for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had a tough last week at work, this is a great chance to re-start. Hopefully, the rest you had during the weekend recharged your batteries and you are a new person now. In case you were among those who did not use the weekend in this manner, then this is the last moment to prepare your mind and body for a successful work week. Keep your chin up, put a smile on that face and energetically shout &lt;em&gt;“Good morning to everyone!”&lt;/em&gt; once you enter your office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the key points of your job that you like and focus on them. Focusing too much on the things that stress you out will not bring any good. If there are some problems you cannot resolve on your own, ask your boss or colleagues for their opinion or help. Attack your duties straight away and get yourself in the work mood. Keep in mind what Aristotle once said: &lt;em&gt;“Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work”&lt;/em&gt;. Focus on the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use your talents in the best possible way and improve yourself constantly. Every person has something to bring to the table and there is a seed of greatness in each one of us. If your current job is not the one that inspires you, then look at the positive sides of it for now. Let your high income be a comforting aspect for the time being and be patient - no one knows what the new week might bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those Hollywood fans among us, just remember Sean Connery’s words: &lt;em&gt;“There is nothing like a challenge to bring out the best in man”&lt;/em&gt;. Are you ready to do your best this week?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Creating Great Customer Support</title>
   <link href="/blog/creating-great-customer-support/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-01T09:56:50-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/creating-great-customer-support</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No matter if you are about to start a business or you manage an already developed company, the importance of providing great customer support is a must. Whether you sell a product or offer a service, the reliability and level of your support is of an extraordinary importance. Although selling a product is the most important part of any business, if your support team fails to keep your customers happy afterwards, then it was all for nothing. As with any other part of your business, building a team of employees that will keep your client base happy is a process that needs to be nourished and re-assessed from time to time. Here are some tips on how to make that process easier and how to achieve better results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/customer-support.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/customer-support-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customer Support System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A customer support representative needs to be a good listener&lt;/strong&gt;. Aside from his technical expertise or other competencies, a customer support representative needs to show good manners at all times and must not interrupt customers when they are complaining about some problem or explaining some of their issues. A customer support member needs to listen to customers carefully, and make notes about complaints. If a support representative cannot resolve the problem straightaway, he is to ensure the client that he understands what the problem is and that he will follow-up on that issue with senior colleagues or other company experts. The last thing that should be done is to simply ignore the problem that the customer has brought out . Hence, &lt;em&gt;being a good listener is a must&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good support representative can make customers feel appreciated&lt;/strong&gt;. Whenever available, a customer support representative should address a customer by his or her name. This gives a personal stamp to a conversation and shows that the support representative cared enough to remember the name of the client. There is nothing worse than a support agent addressing clients with &lt;em&gt;“Dear Customer”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“Dear Client”&lt;/em&gt;. It shows that the representative didn’t want to bother himself with remembering a customer’s name. How rude, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate issues and be prepared for them&lt;/strong&gt;. If you notice some issue repeating more than a couple of times, then prepare yourself for handling it in advance. Assess how that issue could be resolved permanently or come up with a decent workaround which you can suggest to your clients once they start complaining. In case your team is already working on resolving such an issue, then have an estimate on how long it will take for them to finalize. On the other hand, do not promise too short deadlines that you cannot fulfill. &lt;em&gt;Providing a reasonable estimate is of a key value&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always follow-up&lt;/strong&gt;! No matter if your existing customer complained about some issue or requested some sort of an upgrade, make sure to provide a timely follow-up action. By doing so, you are &lt;em&gt;showing to your client that you didn’t forget about their problem&lt;/em&gt; and that you have a good customer support system that  keeps track of all requests and priorities.  In case they complained and you resolved the issue, give your customer a day or two and then follow-up again to see if they noticed any improvement in your service or product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide customers with multiple means of communication with your support team&lt;/strong&gt;. While majority of people nowadays prefer using a phone, keep in mind that some of your clients might be working unusual hours and may need to contact your support during the night, or perhaps only online without the use of a phone. Providing an &lt;em&gt;email, live chat or ticket customer support system&lt;/em&gt; is a great way to show your customers your flexibility and willingness to go the extra mile to keep them happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when and how to apologize&lt;/strong&gt;. Recognizing your own mistakes or flaws of your product or service that somehow affected your client is a virtue of a true professional. In such situations one should not hesitate to apologize to clients. It doesn’t cost anything and it will mean a lot to them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Be Happy in Your Life and Career</title>
   <link href="/blog/be-happy-in-your-life-and-career/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-31T09:26:26-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/be-happy-in-your-life-and-career</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Achieving an adequate level of happiness in your life and career is challenging on many levels. Although this might be a goal that many people share, their perception of the right level of happiness in career and in personal life vary. With that being said, it is obvious that there is no universal recipe on how to achieve happiness in life; however, there are certainly some pointers and questions you need to ask yourself in order to determine the right measures for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/happiness.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/happiness-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Achieve Happiness in Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in this process is achieving full awareness of what makes you happy and how you perceive your work as well as your personal life goals. What are those major or small things in your life that make you happy? What other things or people do you need to include in order o make some of those events and occasions more pleasant for you?Are you hitting all the marks you have set for yourself at your job and what are your long term goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a clear vision about your career desires and the goals you have set for yourself, it is time to proceed to the analysis of the current situation. Are you on the right path to achieve your career goals and do you have enough time to achieve the right level of happiness and satisfaction in your personal life? If your answer is “No”, then you might need to set some better boundaries. If you spend too much time at work, which prevents you from having a fulfilling personal life with your spouse, kids or friends, then you certainly need to take some steps to ensure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/achieving-the-work-life-balance/&quot;&gt;achieve the work-life balance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start noticing that your work life interferes too much into your personal time which you are supposed to dedicate to your family or friends, start enforcing those boundaries and actively work on preventing that from happening again. The same goes the other way around. If you have too many distractions during your work hours coming from your friends or the beloved ones, then work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-productivity/&quot;&gt;ways to increase your productivity&lt;/a&gt; and get yourself back on track as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While money can be a great motivator, especially in companies that financially reward their employees for achieving better results and pay for every minute of overtime, one should not be focused only on money. Some people call it greed whereas some others consider it reasonable economic behavior, but what should be agreed on is that that one should seek for more things in his lives than just money. A healthy relationship with money is a key factor in determining the right amount of hours you wish to dedicate to your work. If you find yourself burning the midnight oil too often, you might want to ask yourself if it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, happiness in life is not something that will come by itself. Actively working on important parts of your life and cultivating things that make you happy should be your constant activities. If you must dedicate a lot of hours to your work, try scheduling some relaxing events whenever possible. Watching a movie with your friend or going to the theater with your spouse might be just the right thing you need for the day to make you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the things that drain your energy is an important step as well. By stepping away from such habits or behaviors you could achieve a much better balance in your life and have enough time and energy for other things, both work or non-work related ones. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/&quot;&gt;Delegating some of your duties&lt;/a&gt; to of your colleagues or employees might give you some room for your personal life or other work assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, is certainly the circle of people that surrounds you. This goes for both your working and private life environment. Surround yourself with successful, hard working people that appreciate the right values and similar things like you do. Be in company of your friends and your loved ones as much as possible and, eventually, you will achieve the needed inner happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.”&lt;/em&gt; - Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are you Effective at Work?</title>
   <link href="/blog/are-you-effective-at-work/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-30T11:37:12-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/are-you-effective-at-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Throughout your work career you must have found yourself in a situation in which you were not satisfied with your colleagues and their speed of work and results. But, how about the other way around? Are you effective at your work and are you that ideal team member that everyone loves working with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/to-do-list.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/to-do-list-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Working Effectively with Others&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is certainly not something you should beat yourself up on a daily basis as it could shatter your self-esteem being too big a bite to chew for some people, asking yourself this question from time to time might help you better grasp how others perceive you as a team member. Whatever the answer might be, here are some tips and tricks on how to work effectively in a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)	Use to-do lists and reminders. There is nothing worse than waiting for your co-workers to finish doing their part so you could proceed with yours, and then suddenly discovering that they completely forgot about that and didn’t do anything. The same rule applies to you. Use all available tools on your computer or smart phone to remind yourself about important stuff to do. That way you will be one of those reliable team members at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)	Communicate your achievements and intentions with your team members on a daily basis. Make sure you are on the right track while doing your daily assignments and communicate your work with other co-workers. Try not to bother them too often with your work related problems, but state your progress of ongoing assignments and projects on a recurring basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)	Come to work and meetings prepared. When heading to a meeting or work, don’t forget to bring the documents you might find useful. In case you are keeping notes about your project progress, make sure they are in your briefcase before you leave your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)	Keep your work desk organized. No matter if you work in an office with your co-workers or from a home office and you communicate with your colleagues online, try to keep your work environment and your desk, in particular, well organized. Always know where your documents or files are; whether we are talking about folders on your computer or piles of paper on your desk. This will save you a lot of time when trying to find a specific piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5)	Avoid procrastinating any sort of work activities. Of course, this might be a bit tricky to achieve, especially if you have a lot of duties or if you are a good employee and your boss always relies on you to complete a lot of important tasks and projects; however, whenever possible, avoid delaying any meetings or task deadlines. If that involves slightly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;better time management&lt;/a&gt; on your end,  or doing some tricks in order to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-increase-productivity/&quot;&gt;increase your productivity&lt;/a&gt;, then so be it. Organize your work hours better in order to achieve more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6)	If you commute via public transportation every day, try doing some minor tasks during that time. Especially if you spend 30-60 minutes (or more) traveling by bus or subway, then try to use that time more efficiently and complete some minor assignments. If nothing else, just go through the list of tasks for that day and come to work well prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7)	Constantly improve your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/bad-workplace-habits/&quot;&gt;work related habits&lt;/a&gt;. Avoid being a person that thinks only of himself. Avoid nourishing bad workplace habits and try to constantly learn and improve yourself. As Abraham Lincoln once said: &lt;em&gt;“I don’t think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8)	Take a moment or two to reflect on a daily basis. What were the things that you achieved during the previous day or week? What are those things that you could have done better? Do not dwell over some failures, but try to learn from mistakes and take your following opportunities to make an improvement. Working effectively with others is an easily attainable goal for those who are aware of the benefits of good team work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Causes for Missing Deadlines and Solutions</title>
   <link href="/blog/causes-for-missing-deadlines-and-solutions/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-25T09:19:57-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/causes-for-missing-deadlines-and-solutions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you get frequent assignments from your manager or employer, then you are probably aware of the pressure to complete those tasks on time. Yet, sometimes you hardly make to complete some of the projects on time or you miss your deadline for the task you expected it wouldn’t take that long. What happened there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-you-properly-prioritize&quot;&gt;Do you properly prioritize?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/meet-deadlines.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/meet-deadlines-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Do You Meet Deadlines?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very important that you prioritize your assignments properly. Do not hesitate to use all kinds of tools or reminders to sort your tasks by priority and estimate the time needed for each of them. Even a pen and a piece of paper might do the trick, but if possible, try using one of those cloud tools for your computer or smart phone to remind you about your tasks or assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of minutes wasted on keeping track of your list of priorities and updating it properly might go long way later on when you are try to meet your deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-you-manage-your-time-effectively-enough&quot;&gt;Do you manage your time effectively enough?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frequently people do not properly estimate the time needed for a certain task. At the same time, certain assignments may seem easy at start, but could get very complicated once you dig in. On top of this, there are all sorts of distractions and concentration issues that can obstruct you from meeting your deadline. So, good assessment of time needed for a certain activity along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;effective time management techniques&lt;/a&gt; is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-you-frequently-multitask&quot;&gt;Do you frequently multitask?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you frequently find yourself multitasking in order to meet your deadlines for more than one assignment? According to some recent studies, multitasking appears as not that effective as people usually think. It is proven that doing a single task at a time represents a more efficient way of handling your job priorities. Once you concentrate on one task, try to complete it before proceeding to the next one. This way your concentration will be better and you will be more detailed and precise with each of your assignments. Once you are done with one, take a small break and reward yourself with a nice 5-10 minute walk, or some relaxing music, and then proceed to another task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-you-handle-distractions-in-a-proper-way&quot;&gt;Can you handle distractions in a proper way?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work in an office and your colleagues frequently have a joke to tell or they just like to chit-chat during the work hours, you might be tempted to join them. Also, if you work in front of the computer and have a hard time resisting to watch all those funny videos your friends post on their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or Twitter, then you need to deal better with those distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a proper way of dealing with them. Using earplugs if you are work in a noisy office, or closing down all browsers, social network notifications or silencing your cell phone can help you concentrate better. Once one of your tasks is completed, reward yourself with 5-10 minutes of chit chat with your co-workers or check out what’s new on your favorite news or sport portals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-you-communicate-about-your-deadline-with-your-supervisor-on-time&quot;&gt;Do you communicate about your deadline with your supervisor on time?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By talking with your supervisor, you can assess the priorities of certain tasks and how flexible some of the deadlines might be. Even if you are falling behind with a certain assignment, just notifying your manager or employer about that can be enough for him to dedicate an additional resource to help you meet the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, it is a very bad practice to stay silent until your deadline is there and notify your boss that you didn’t make it. Communicate that on time! You will see a much better result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you meet deadlines? We would like to hear some of your proven techniques. Let’s share some best practices!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Give Feedback</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-give-feedback/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-24T11:23:51-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-give-feedback</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Giving effective feedback is an important learning step in the process of mastering any type of job or work. Yet, it is important to find a good way to do that, without putting people on defense or wasting time on giving unproductive feedback that would lead to no better result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the reasons on why you are giving particular feedback and finding the best method to do that might be sometimes a challenge. If you are provide feedback to your employees or colleagues, then you need to find the right way to do that, which does not necessarily need to be the same as if you were a customer in a store providing your feedback on their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provide timely feedback&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/feedback.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/feedback-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Giving Effective Feedback&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing worse than waiting for a whole set of observations to pile up so you could state your objections to your employees or colleagues once in a couple of months. By that time, they might have forgotten many of those situations and such feedback may not be as productive as the one you state immediately after something happens. Hence, providing immediate feedback is a very important step in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provide regular feedback&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your employees or colleagues used to hearing feedback on their work results. By doing so, you take that unpleasant feeling from the table and create an environment in which a discussion about results and objections is normal in your company. Such feedback does not necessarily need to be negative; on the contrary, it is advisable to provide both positive and negative feedback whenever there is a reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create safety and keep a positive tone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you didn’t like what your employee or co-worker did, try to take a positive approach. You do not necessarily want to broadcast such an opinion in front of everyone, so creating a safe environment for that employee to receive some criticism is very important. On the other hand, even when you do have a negative set of feedback to provide, try to take a positive approach as much as possible. Instead of saying “You are bad at handling such technical calls”, try saying “Let’s try to work on your handling of those technical calls”. Although you are practically saying the same thing with the previous two statements, the latter might produce much better results with the person receiving the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be precise and specific&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not just act out on your team member without letting them know what exactly you find problematic in their way of handling work. The outcome of such feedback might be reduced confidence of that person and no willingness to improve. If there is more than one thing you wish to point out, then just write down a reminder and try to be as specific as possible when providing your feedback. Whenever possible, try to provide a solution as well. Instead of just criticizing, suggest an alternative way that can lead to a better result.  Perhaps your employee wants to be better, but just doesn’t know how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not give feedback that sounds mean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if your employee did some clumsy move that you perhaps even find stupid, do not say that directly. If you provide feedback that just sounds mean, you might ruin their self-esteem and confidence at the same time not getting any better results. As already mentioned, try to provide them with some constructive criticism. If you got upset over some issue, and you are not sure you can keep yourself positive, then try to calm yourself down and focus on how to get the best possible outcome from such a  situation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Who is Better at Managing Money: Men or Women?</title>
   <link href="/blog/who-is-better-at-managing-money/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-23T12:45:24-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/who-is-better-at-managing-money</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although women openly admit that they spend more money than men, the results of an international survey revealed that women are better at managing money than men. Let’s take a closer look at some facts that might debunk some false stereotypes, especially the ones regarding personal money management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frittering away money on needless purchases in a form of an extra pair of Louboutin shoes or a handbag from the latest Moschino collection has turned out to be a myth unjustly imposed on women. What keeps being disregarded is that men like gadgets, gizmos and electronics and accordingly they like to spend money on them. Large amounts of money, to be more precise. Heard of minidrons? Seen the latest Sony short throw 4K projector, the one that will make a true home cinema out of your living room? Not to mention gnar boards that are becoming increasingly popular among the male population. And these high-tech gadgets cost. An arm and a leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/money-management.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/money-management-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Managing Money&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most women who keep track of their spending, make regular mortgage or house payments, men tend to build up debts through loans and credit cards or even forget to pay bills. Women, on the other hand, have not only proved to be good at managing debts but also at investing. Being open for assistance, ready to accept help or advice, women are nowadays recognized as better investors than man. Additionally, the results of a recent survey also show that women, generally, lack aggressiveness and impulsiveness when it comes to investing, some of the characteristics typical of men. They, on the contrary, tend to be risk-averse investors, playing it safe being their advantage in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to saving, it must be said that men are bigger savers than women. The fact that they earn less than their male counterparts impedes them, to an extent, from making bigger savings. Namely, as statistics say that women live longer than men, they tend to put bigger percentages of their paychecks into their retirement savings plans.  Good financial literacy and adequate plans for the future cannot help them win the savings game, in general. Unfortunately, the gender wealth gap has taken its toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is true that men and women can act differently when personal money management is in question, statistics should be taken with pinch of salt. The factors which may seem even more important are psychological traits that come with each individual and his/her approaches towards finance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Achieving the Work-Life Balance</title>
   <link href="/blog/achieving-the-work-life-balance/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-18T10:51:06-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/achieving-the-work-life-balance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the world where technology blurred the line between work and personal time, it is hard to separate those two important aspects of one’s life. When should work stop? &lt;em&gt;How can I achieve a healthy balance between my job and my personal life?&lt;/em&gt; These are just some of the questions that bother many people who are aware of the importance of work life balance. Here are some of the things you could do to achieve this supreme goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/work-life-balance.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/work-life-balance-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Managing Work Life Balance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Assess the priorities in your life.&lt;/strong&gt; If needed, make a formal list which will help you to easier understand and see your priorities. Ask yourself what would be the most important things that you would like to achieve or maintain in your life and make a list of 5-10 things. Once that you have that list in place, it should be much easier for you to focus on those priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;Manage your work time&lt;/a&gt; better.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to determine the tasks that take you too much time on a daily or weekly basis. If available, you can use some tools for time tracking in order to have a clear vision of your work day and of the pain points that simply waste too much of your precious time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Do not multitask and focus on one thing at a time.&lt;/strong&gt; It is proven that multitasking will not get you more things done than focusing on one thing at a time. What’s even worse is that multitasking can make you feel overwhelmed and probably frustrated at some point. This all could lead to degradation of your productivity and having to spend more of your free time on job related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Turn off your cell phone while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/parenting-and-business/&quot;&gt;spending time with your kids&lt;/a&gt; or spouse.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to have some quality time with your friends, spouse or kids you must stop worrying about work all the time or checking your email 10 times in an hour. If you really must, limit yourself to one-two email checks before you go to bed or after dinner. At other times, try to keep your cell phone turned off or simply leave it at home if you are going out with your friends (this does not apply if you are expecting some really important call, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Schedule your private time.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are so passionate about your work that it is hard for you to resist doing some of your work duties, no matter how minor they may seem, even when you are not in the office, try to schedule yourself for certain events which might help you focus better on your private life. That can be either watching a football game with your friends, going out to the theater,  or simply reading a book. Any kind of an activity that makes you relax deserves a recurring spot in your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Work on some healthy habits.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have enough sleep? Do you eat and drink healthily? Do you exercise at least once in a while? All these questions are here to help you determine whether or not you are good at managing work life balance. Try to work on these things and you will be amazed how a slightly better lunch menu and a little bit of exercising can make you feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;When was the last time you went on vacation and for how long?&lt;/strong&gt; Try to book at least a 10-15 days’ vacation every year. If you prefer winter over summer, you can plan on visiting some nice ski resort and spend your vacation time with your dearest ones surrounded by idyllic nature . This will re-charge your batteries for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Learn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/&quot;&gt;how to delegate better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a manager and you feel exhausted after fulfilling your daily tasks, re-think the process of delegating. Do you have the right set of people working for you? Do you trust them enough to delegate some tasks to them? How about some really important assignments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Keep re-evaluating all these things on a recurring basis.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are constantly finding yourself struggling to find a right balance, then make a task of re-evaluating your work – life balance a repeating one. Every once in a while sit down and take some time to go through these steps over again. Are you getting some good results or is there some additional tweaking to be made?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Become a Great Sales Person</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-become-a-great-sales-person/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-17T11:42:20-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-become-a-great-sales-person</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to survive in today’s economy is to be the best at what you do. While it is not that easy to explain how to become the best salesperson, obviously there are certain things that differentiate a great from a mediocre salesman. Here are some tips and tricks you can use to improve your skills and join the club of the most successful salesmen in your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observe first.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not go straight to your well-rehearsed selling story. Try to listen to prospects’ needs first and understand what exactly is that they need. Let them clarify what their expectations regarding the product or the service are and what they would like to achieve. By grasping their needs better, you can re-adjust your approach and explain some of the gains the client will get with your product or service that they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show yourself as a trustworthy person.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though you might be tempted to upsell your product, you should be careful at start and position yourself as an honest  seller whose primary goal is to make the client happy and then, on the second place, to make a sale. If someone doesn’t trust you, you will definitely not make a sale. Hence, take some time to build yourself as an honest and reliable person before switching to the sales mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be an expert in your niche.&lt;/strong&gt; If you sell a product or a service, be aware of what your competitors offer and at which prices. With that experience you can always compare your product with others on the market and present some of the key values of your product over your competitors based on the actual facts. Knowing technical facts about your product and the niche industry, in general, is a big plus and it will definitely present you as a knowledgeable person in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not just try to make a sale, try to build a business.&lt;/strong&gt; Although making a sale might be your ultimate goal, by going the extra mile you are setting the stage to be recognized as an outstanding person to do business with and you might get some valuable recommendation from your client to their friends, relatives and business associates. So, even if you do not make a sale, do your best to present yourself as a person valuable to do business in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate objections and be ready for answers.&lt;/strong&gt; Be aware of all the pros and cons of your product and be ready to address some of the concerns. Always be prepared to explain to your clients why your product is more expensive than some other ones and what the benefits of your product are, especially the ones they will not get with the cheaper products. Similarly, have an answer to why your product is cheaper than others no matter how easier this question may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/become-a-great-salesman.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/become-a-great-salesman-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Become the Best Salesperson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver more than you promise.&lt;/strong&gt; If you made some promises during the sales process, make sure you fulfill them. If possible, go even an extra step and provide a customer with more than you have promised. This is something that will turn your one time purchase client into a loyal returning customer. With an army of loyal customers buzzing about your company, your business will be rocketed into the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always try to follow up!&lt;/strong&gt; If you made a sale, that’s not the reason to forget about the client. Nourish your relationships with your past clients and keep the connection alive, whenever possible. In case you have contact details of your clients, then make sure to follow up after making a sale and confirm that they are happy and satisfied with their purchase. Turn your happy clients into returning customers by going the extra mile and showing some extra care.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Negotiate a Higher Salary</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-negotiate-a-higher-salary/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-16T10:12:19-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-negotiate-a-higher-salary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whether you are just negotiating the salary for a new job offered to you, or you already have a job and you are thinking about the ways to ask for a raise, some of the salary negotiation tactics mentioned in this article might come very handy. As always, we are not writing an article that is supposed to be a “know-it-all-article” but we are sure that some of the tips you will read here will be very useful should you find yourself in the above-mentioned situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research your work value. Before even starting a salary raise negotiation, be aware of your work value upfront by researching the topic on time. Have in mind that your work value is not the same category as your personal value. Be reasonable when assessing your professional value and think of an ideal salary you would like to have. Also, think about the minimum wage you would work for and have both figures prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/raise-negotiation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/raise-negotiation-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Salary Raise Negotiation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deal with your fears and all self-esteem issues. Do not let the fear factor hold you down from a salary raise negotiation with your future or current employer. Just because you are afraid of hearing “&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;” as an answer, remember that you might hear “&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;” as well. Do not just expect that your boss or manager will worry about this kind of stuff so be prepared to politely ask for a raise or a higher pay rate. If you are trying to persuade yourself that you might not be worth of a higher salary or that you have already been offered with enough, then think those things through. Do not let your self-esteem issues hold you back and do not put yourself down. If you believe that your professional level is higher than what you are paid for, then step up for yourself and state the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not let your bad experience from the past control your future. If you were already in a similar situation in the past, and heard “&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;” to such a request too many times, do not let that bad experience affect your future. Be aware of your value, forget the past, and go for it! If you do not ask, you will never hear a “&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to make a counteroffer. If your (future) manager makes the offer first, be prepared to make a counter offer in case the offered salary does not satisfy you. This is why it’s important to do some research first and get acquainted with the industry pay rates and rates of your colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are the first stating the figure, go slightly higher than expected. The expert opinions do not match on this topic. While some claim that it’s the best option to be the first one putting out the figure on the table and that all negotiations will revolve around that first figure later on, others think that it’s much better to let your employer state the offer first. However, if you are the first one putting the figure out there, make sure your initial proposal is slightly higher than the figure you would be happy with. This gives you room to negotiate a little bit and show flexibility on your side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not take things personally. That’s one of the worst things you could do. Remember that business is business, and that you are not negotiating your personal value. Keep in mind that even if you hear “&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;” as an answer, there might be a reason behind it of which you are currently not aware. With today’s economy it would not be a surprise if some companies are struggling to survive, so keep those things in mind. This is why it is important to think about the rock bottom salary for which you would be prepared to work. When the economy and the business starts picking up, there will be more chances to re-negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice before the actual conversation. If you are the type of person that easily gets embarrassed or starts caving under pressure, then make sure you rehearse your conversation well before the actual salary raise negotiation. Get prepared, stand in front of your mirror and practice all the possible scenarios and outcomes. What will you say and how will you behave if you hear a simple “&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;”? What if you hear “&lt;em&gt;Not right now, but we’ll see in the future&lt;/em&gt;”? How about “&lt;em&gt;No way&lt;/em&gt;”? And lastly, but most importantly, how will you react and feel if you hear a “&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;”?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Increase Your Productivity</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-increase-productivity/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-11T09:08:43-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-increase-productivity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mentioning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/time-management-techniques/&quot;&gt;time management techniques and tips&lt;/a&gt; to some managers can cause them feel noxious because it usually suggests that they will simply have to cram more stuff into their already busy schedule. With today’s continuously developing technology and online tools that are supposed to help us organize our time better and increase our productivity as an ultimate goal, why do we constantly find ourselves overwhelmed with work and rushing to fulfill all our tasks on time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/increase-productivity.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/increase-productivity-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to increase productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the development of the Internet and technology gives us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/small-business-and-technology/&quot;&gt;tools to help us increase workplace productivity&lt;/a&gt;, it also provides many distractions that we should watch out for. Using the tools available in the best possible way is a challenge, but let’s see what the best measures are on how to increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Do not multitask.&lt;/strong&gt; Recent studies show that contrary to a widespread opinion, multitasking actually ruins our productivity. Instead, we should always focus on one task at a time and get it done as soon as possible, so we could move on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Make a list of your assignments for the day.&lt;/strong&gt; If possible, try to make such a list a night before, so once your work day starts, you are ready to start with the work immediately and take on your hardest tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Start the day with the most important and hardest tasks.&lt;/strong&gt; Take care of your hardest and most important tasks while you are still full of energy and well rested. Once you get those done, you can slowly move to the less important tasks, which can optionally be left for some other day as well in case you are not in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Reward yourself for getting done some of those big tasks.&lt;/strong&gt; Think of some small things that please you and reward yourself with them once you get some important task done. It might sound silly, but knowing that there is a small reward at the end might help you speed up a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/have-a-break.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/have-a-break-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Have a break - Employee scheduling solution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Schedule yourself for small breaks.&lt;/strong&gt; As the day goes by, take a couple of small breaks that will help you refresh your mind and body and get energized for the tasks still waiting for you. Even taking a stroll to the bathroom, washing your face and hands and getting back to your work station will serve the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Eliminate all distractions.&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned earlier, the Internet indeed offers a lot of tools that can help you boost your productivity; however, it offers as many, if not more, distractions as well. So be careful and do not allow yourself to spend half of your day surfing or checking your Facebook or Twitter status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Work from home whenever possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoiding commuting on a daily basis saves you a lot of time that you would spend in the traffic or preparing for work. If your job allows, try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/remote-working/&quot;&gt;working from home&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Organize your work environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you work from your company’s or home office, keep it well organized at all times. There is no bigger waste of time than having to search through a pile of documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Avoid having TV turned on while working.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a big chance that some interesting TV show will distract your attention from work and you might easily find yourself watching TV for an hour instead of working. Listening to nice and relaxing music in the background while working should be a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Bundle similar tasks.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have some similar tasks of less importance, then always  try to batch them up into a single time slot and get them done when you are in the mood for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Get plenty of sleep and exercise whenever possible.&lt;/strong&gt; When having a break, doing a couple of exercises might help you feel much better, instead of just kicking back in your chair or bed and watching TV. A good night sleep may help you feel much better and energized to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Write down important stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not just go by thinking “I will remember this”. Always have a piece of paper and a pen close to you during your day and write down all the important stuff. It will help you feel more relaxed knowing that you do not have to bother yourself by constantly reminding yourself about important tasks for later on that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the steps you can take to increase workplace productivity. We encourage you to think of other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/unwind-end-day/&quot;&gt;ways that might help you relax&lt;/a&gt; during your breaks and after-work hours and energize better for a new day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Re-capping 2014 and Looking Forward to 2015</title>
   <link href="/blog/re-capping-2014/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-10T11:00:18-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/re-capping-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2014 was a great year for NimbleSchedule! Naming all the changes and improvements we did over the last year would be a mission impossible because a lot of things happened and changed. To name just a few – we established partnerships with reputable names in the field of payroll and POS terminal services, our team expanded tremendously and the client base doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2014, there were some invaluable additions to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/meet-team/&quot;&gt;executive team&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, Nimble Software Systems Inc. named its new CEO - Mr Sasha Poljak, an experienced entrepreneur with vast experience in the business world; Mr Tim Skansi, a professional with impressive work history, was named the CFO of the company whereas the co-founder of the company, Mr Peter Swaniker, assumed the role of the CTO thus continuing to lead the engineering team in their mission of perfecting the core product to the benefit of all our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NimbleSchedule2014.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/NimbleSchedule2014-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling - Re-capping 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2014, our customer support team changed dramatically and doubled the number of agents. What is a great product without a hard working customer support team behind it? With that question in mind, our company made a lot of improvements in this area and increased the level of support provided to our respectful customers. The same trends were followed in the sales, marketing and IT departments as well, resulting in the increased number of staff members in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those staffing changes, the software improvements and the reputation rise of our company made the number of clients start growing rapidly. We are proud to say that the number of companies using our employee scheduling software doubled during 2014. What a year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increased number of developers and orchestrated leadership of the executive team, our product was improved significantly over the course of the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• We &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/partner-integrations/&quot;&gt;integrated with a number of prestigious companies&lt;/a&gt; in different areas. To name a few, we integrated with Quickbooks Online, ADP, Lightspeed and Kounta. Besides our already established integrations with BambooHR and Zenpayroll, these integrations, which came at no extra charge to our or their clients, led to significant functionality gains for our customers. As a result of a reputation increase, other companies like Trax Payroll and SimplePay recognized their interest in building an integration with our system from their end to the benefit of mutual business clients of ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• New features and functionalities were being constantly implemented in the system over the last year. With every bi-weekly update we had, a new bundle of tools and options was added to the system and improved its overall flexibility and usability of. New reports, the Audit Log functionality in particular, added significant value to the ways of tracking and supervising a company’s productivity and the overall operational process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The integration with various SDK systems enabled the use of various fingerprint scanners along with our time attendance system. Apart from other employee time tracking options, such as the mobile phone time clock option and the QR Code scanner option, the addition of biometric time attendance significantly improved our offer and extended the functionality of our reliable and flexible time clock module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With gained experience and feedback collected from our business clients, our company is making significant steps in re-designing the user interface to make the use of our employee scheduling system easier and more reliable. With these ideas in mind, we rolled into 2015 with the whole team working on the new interface and pitching in with new ideas and enhanced features for our clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following year we intend to bring out some extraordinary new features and grow even more. It seems that nothing will stop us from serving our customers even better and building the product that will cover even a wider customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look ahead to 2015, new ideas together with the goals set for this year as well as the achievements from the past year give us many reasons to be optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Creating a Meaningful Video for Your Start Up</title>
   <link href="/blog/promotional-video-for-business/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-04T09:31:35-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/promotional-video-for-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are about to start creating a promo video for your start-up company, there are a couple of useful tips that might help you save a lot of time and headaches. No matter if you are running a B2B or B2C type of business, most of the rules on how to create a promotional video are pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/how-to-create-promo-video.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/how-to-create-promo-video-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Promotional Video for Business&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend time on building a quality script.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you are hiring another company or a professional to make a video for you, it would be desirable to have a prepared script with the key points and values you wish to present to your audience. There is always room for adjustments later on but at least have a rough version of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your targeted audience.&lt;/strong&gt; It is not all the same if you are targeting company managers for some accounting software or housewives for a new cleaning detergent. Hence, your tone, presentation style and material must be adjusted to your business audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include the content of best quality.&lt;/strong&gt; The material with which you are about to start your project must be of supreme quality so make sure that the content is closest to perfect as much as possible. Having low resolution images, or amateurish video footages will definitely decrease the value of your promo video no matter how good your editing or voice over is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double check the content’s copyright.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to use materials from various stock markets or online resources, make sure that their license agreements are in place and that they allow you to use the content in the way you intend. The best option is always to record your own material, fresh and original that no one else used anywhere else. This will give your video a unique look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduce and go straight to the point.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t try to tell long stories or bother your audience with technical explanations. Your promo video should not be longer than a couple of minutes and you should highlight just some of the best features or functionalities of your product or service. If you must use text, then try to keep it short and focus on some catchphrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not forget to call to action!&lt;/strong&gt; Although it might seem logical that someone who liked your video will follow-up by visiting your website, Facebook page or Twitter account, that might not be always the case. Make sure to always include a call to action and give some key information to the viewer. In case you would prefer your audience to visit your website, then clearly write the address of your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your working version safe for future re-use.&lt;/strong&gt; It might seem needless to keep all working versions and files once you have your video done and published, but you never know when you might need that video slightly changed in the future. During some holidays you can decide to build a custom tailored video with special promo actions or discounts, and that’s exactly when you may want to re-use your old video and just edit certain parts of it. By changing a couple of scenes, or adding different background music your video will look fresh new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your new promo video for the test drive.&lt;/strong&gt; If possible, the best way would be to have a couple of volunteers from your current client base or other objective people watch your video and write down their observations. Even if you are 100% satisfied with your new promo video, this might be very useful to determine how others perceive your business through the eyes of your new video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote! Promote! Promote!&lt;/strong&gt; Keep in mind that company promo videos will hardly spread out by themselves. If you want your new video to reach to the widest possible audience, then do not hesitate to promote your new content in the best possible ways. Post it on Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, your company’s website or blog, and anywhere else where you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have some tips or tricks on how to create a promotional video for business? Let us know about them!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People spend a lot of time at their work so it is very important for them to reduce their bad workplace habits to a minimum. Besides irritating colleagues and managers, one might prevent oneself from a possible promotion or better success in one’s career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases people are not even aware of their bad workplace habits. So for starters, recognizing your bad habits at your work is a crucial step in improving yourself as a colleague as well as raising your productivity and work related success. A good start would be to keep a journal of your work productivity and assignments during the day and make a note of everything you do. Later on you can analyze your results and see what kind of distractions are the ones causing you to fail to meet certain deadlines or achieve a better productivity rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bad-habits.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bad-habits-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bad Workplace Behavior&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you frequently find yourself procrastinating and then rushing to complete tasks? If so, then finding a cause for such a behavior or eliminating all sorts of distractions might help you organize your work life better and achieve better results. Even if you do manage to meet your work related deadlines, rushing to complete your work at the last minute must have certain impacts on the quality of your work. It can also put a great pressure on other team members and colleagues working with you on certain projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent grumbling about various things at your work can also cause some negative effects. Aside from bringing a negative tone to your work environment, it also creates a bad working atmosphere for other workers. Hence, trying to find some positive sides even in things or co-workers that you might not particularly like might set a better mood for everyone to do their job better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/how-to-give-and-receive-criticism/&quot;&gt;accept constructive criticism&lt;/a&gt; in the same way as you can hand it out to others? There’s nothing worse than having colleagues or employees who can’t take a constructive critique as something positive and try to learn and improve from it. Instead, they immediately start arguing and defending their actions, which essentially prevents them from making a better progress in their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself frequently proposing someone else to do the task assigned to you because you think they’ll be a better fit? Although it is quite normal to delegate certain tasks to others from time to time, there’s a big difference between avoiding work and delegating tasks. Unless you are a manager, avoid delegating tasks to others as much as possible. It can cause some frustrations on your colleagues’ ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually there is more than one way to say things. If you are not completely happy with someone else’s work or results, think twice before expressing yourself. Find the best way to say certain things, and think through your wording before actually saying those words. Sometimes it might be much better to say “This is a good start, there are just some things I would change” instead of the plain old “This is not good. Please do your work again”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantly running late for meetings can cause bad side effects. Besides being a completely bad workplace behavior, you can create a chain reaction both for yourself and others especially if you are already scheduled for that particular work day. Respecting your peers time is usually perceived as a good habit whereas the opposite behavior is considered a bad one and has a negative impact on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last, but not the least is work enthusiasm. People love being surrounded by enthusiastic colleagues, which inspires them to be better at their work as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of bad workplace habits doesn’t finish there - there are a lot of other things we could mention in this article; yet, these would be some of the key pain points. Remember to practice good habits on a daily basis and make a routine of certain things. By doing so, and by minimizing the effect of bad habits you will set yourself to a path of career success.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Give and Receive Criticism</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-give-and-receive-criticism/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-02T11:42:53-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-give-and-receive-criticism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although it used to have a neutral connotation, criticism has started getting a negative tone lately. With the expansion of Internet use, a new trend emerged, the one of inserting all sorts of personal hate and vicious comments in, at first glance, open minded criticism. Therefore, it has become important for one to learn how to give and receive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding before criticizing.&lt;/em&gt; In order to criticize a product in the best possible way, first you have to understand what that product is and what it is not. If you simply do not understand the product and wish to criticize it because of not being able to understand it, you are definitely not on the right track. Take some time to learn about the product and about the intentions that person of the producer before providing your fair and unbiased review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fairness and positive sides.&lt;/em&gt; When reviewing any type of a product or service, you have to insist on fairness. Before pointing out the negative sides and the things you don’t like, ask yourself about the positive things first. What are the things that you do like about some product or service? Isn’t it fair to point out those positive key values as much as the ones you find negative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measurements and comparison points.&lt;/em&gt; Can people who are not humble be good critics? Are the ones who think they know it all just too arrogant to be fair?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting to criticize someone else’s work, be sure you have a decent knowledge of the niche you are about to criticize. Once you acquire it, then take some time to investigate competitors in that same industry and check what values they have to offer. With those things in mind, and with a vision of what measurement standards are, you can start writing your fair opinion about a specific product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never focus on personal things.&lt;/em&gt; If you are criticizing someone’s articles, why would you focus on that person instead on a specific article? If the person writing those articles is not pretty according to your standards, or wears a funky looking sweater, how does that affect the quality of the written articles and their content, in general? &lt;strong&gt;A good criticism should never be personal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5-star-review.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5-star-review-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Accept and Receive Criticism With Grace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to receive and process a constructive criticism could be the key to your professional success. There are many things you can learn from a good analysis of your products or services, so try to make the best use out of it. Such an attitude is very important especially when it comes to accepting criticism at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid arguing with malicious critics.&lt;/em&gt; Remember that such criticisms speak more about those declaring them than about you or your work. Restrain yourself from falling into a trap of arguing with such people. Nothing good can come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give your critic the benefit of a doubt.&lt;/em&gt; There is no person in the history of the world that was always right. With that being said, remember that there is always a probability that you might have gone the wrong way with some work or product. Hence, scrutinize your work routine and re-check all the steps you have made. Try to visualize what the results would be if you did things as written in that critique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refrain from giving sarcastic or arrogant responses.&lt;/em&gt; Be positive and accept every objective criticism as a man! Wining around and showing an unprofessional attitude will just ruin your reputation. Always provide a courteous and polite response and take some time to evaluate the things you’ve heard or read about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Make the Most of Your LinkedIn Profile</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-linkedin-profile/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-28T11:17:45-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-linkedin-profile</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why should your LinkedIn profile be any different from your Facebook profile? What are some tips and tricks you can apply while creating your LinkedIn profile to make it look more professional?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to answer these questions while at the same time focusing on LinkedIn profile optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since LinkedIn is a business type of network, then there is a clear difference between Facebook and LinkedIn. While you can be goofy on your personal Facebook profile, LinkedIn is not the place for clowning around. Being fun and flaky on Facebook is OK, but when the time comes to leave a good impression on your business partners or potential clients and associates you might want to tone down a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/linkedin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/linkedin-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The benefits of your LinkedIn profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key elements of having a professionally looking LinkedIn profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Have the right, high resolution, professional-looking profile photo. A recent headshot photo might do the trick. Your future employer, or potential client might not necessarily want to see your dog performing funny tricks on your LinkedIn profile photo. Keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Add a short and straight to the point headline and summary. Both fields are equally important, so pay extra attention to make them sound clear and easy to understand. First impressions are important, so make them worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Proofread your posted information. Make sure you have used the proper grammar and that you have no spelling errors. Having such errors could leave an impression to your visitors that you did not care too much about creating the best possible LinkedIn profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Customize your profile URL to something meaningful. Having a bunch of numbers in your profile URL might look a bit odd, or hard to remember. Do your best to leave a positive impression on your profile visitors. Having a meaningful URL is one of the ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Add detailed information about yourself. Consider that as a version of your resume, so make sure you write down your employment history as well as the duties you have done for your past employers. Also, don’t forget to mention your current job position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Do not lie about anything. Nowadays everything can be checked very easily online, so lying about your work history or education would only show to your profile visitors that you are not a trustworthy person. You can perhaps skip something you are not proud of, but do not just make stuff up. That will look unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Use LinkedIn applications to enhance your profile. For example, if you are a blog writer, you can easily connect your WordPress blog with your LinkedIn profile and have your article topics appear there. You can also connect your Twitter if you believe your tweets would sound interesting to your LinkedIn connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•	Add relevant keywords to your profile text. Keep in mind that people may be using search engines to find professionals from certain areas, so adding good keywords might help position your profile link on the first page of search engine results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a professional looking LinkedIn profile, let’s see how you can get more exposure. 
Besides adding the right keywords for SE optimization, what are the other methods of getting some real and quality visitors to your profile and keeping your existing connections interested?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Use LinkedIn Groups. There are many different groups covering various niche industries. You can find a group covering your specific profession and try to be active there. Remember that some companies even post job ads in such groups, so try monitoring other posts as much as you can if you are seeking a job. If not, you can never know when a nice reputation among fellow colleagues from the same profession might come useful. So be active in those groups and gain some profile exposure from people that matter in your profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Use LinkedIn badges on your blog, website or forum posts. If you own or maintain a website or a blog, make sure you have a decent place on your website with a badge that is linked to your LinkedIn profile. This will not only give your profile some additional exposure, but it will also tell your website visitors more about you and present them with your professional image. The benefits will be manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Add your LinkedIn profile link to your email messages. If you frequently communicate with clients, then it might be a good idea to add your LinkedIn profile to your email signature. This will create some additional exposure of your profile and, at the same time, your customers and clients will be able to see who you really are. Use that personal touch to create a better connection with your clients and add more exposure to your profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the measures that you can undertake in order to ensure LinkedIn profile optimization so do not be afraid to explore them to present yourself in the best professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Make the Job You Hate Bearable</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-make-the-job-you-hate-bearable/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-26T10:57:33-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-make-the-job-you-hate-bearable</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those people who feel almost sick and noxious when having to go to work, by reading this article you will learn how to love your job again. Although the latest research shows that people are becoming more and more unsatisfied with their jobs, ask yourself twice whether or not this is the right time to change your career. Perhaps, undertaking certain some small steps might do the trick for now and make your job bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/make-your-job-bearable.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/make-your-job-bearable-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Make Your Job Bearable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: You do this work because you are paid to do it. Have satisfaction in the money you are making with this job and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: With today’s economy, consider yourself lucky to have a job at all. This is probably not the best time to change careers or look for another job, especially due to the economic recession. You might spend months looking for a new job, and even when you do find it, no one can make that guarantee that the new company will survive this recession. Therefore, stick with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Do your work the best way you can. Even if you do not like what you do for a living, take some pride in your work results. There are many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/problem-solving-techniques/&quot;&gt;problem solving techniques&lt;/a&gt; you can apply to make your situation look better. If you have to do this job, then give your best shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Alleviate the lack of happiness with your work with an increase of happiness and contentment in your personal life. Spend more time with your family and friends, or find some hobbies that would occupy your mind. Regular physical exercises and activities, or jogging might help release some of the stress. If you are a parent, spend more time with your children and try to achieve true emotional satisfaction (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/parenting-and-business/&quot;&gt;Business and Parenting&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Consider the possibilities to change at least part of your work duties. Is your manager perhaps interested in rotating some of the employees by assigning them different positions in the company? Are there any other tasks that you like more and that you could take on, which would eventually make your job a little more bearable? These are all the things you could explore discreetly without raising any eyebrows in your company. By slightly migrating your work duties toward new stuff, you might just turn your work day into a much more pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Doing good deeds can make you feel better about yourself. In case your company sometimes organizes some charities or volunteer activities, try joining one and the satisfaction of doing a selfless good deed can make you feel much better about yourself and about your current job. Even if there is no such opportunity, tutoring or helping some younger colleague may bring that satisfaction you need at your work place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 7: Focus on positive sides and stay strong. No matter what type of work you do, there always must be some positive side of it, as well. In case those negative things occupy too much of your attention, try focusing on positive things more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the things you could do to help you re-discover the reasons to love your job again and to make yourself feel better about your work in general. Depending on your exact line of business and circumstances, there might be measures from this list that you cannot directly apply in your case. Nevertheless, take it as a challenge to explore the new ways of improving your working environment and your inner happiness with your job.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are You a Workaholic?</title>
   <link href="/blog/signs-of-a-workaholic/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-21T09:48:13-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/signs-of-a-workaholic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recognizing signs of a workaholic or even the fact that you are a workaholic and doing something about it is quite difficult because the whole society actually praises such behavior. By staying longer hours in the office and answering your emails even while on a lunch break or vacation, you might get a tap on the back from your boss, but is that a healthy behavior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**_Quite often people may not even recognize that they are workaholics. Most of those hard working people even brag with the fact that they work 10-12 hour shifts or that they rarely use their eligible paid vacation time and paid time off. Yes, this kind of behavior heavily affects their interpersonal relationship with friends, family members or even kids, on top of affecting their health as well._**&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/workaholic.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/workaholic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;workaholic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with any other addiction, people who are workaholics initially feel “high” and they are very satisfied with their work results. However, they quickly become tired, stressed and easily irritated. Apart from these workaholism symptoms, their productivity actually lowers with more hours spent in the office. When that happens, it is critical to understand the effects of workaholic behavior and to take appropriate measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Are you constantly thinking about your work even when at dinner with your family, or on vacation?&lt;/strong&gt;
** • Do you work longer and harder than most of your colleagues?**
** • Are your family members or friends complaining that you spend too much time at work?**
** • Do you neglect your health while pursuing your career?**
** • Do you sometimes catch yourself talking too much about work when you are out for a drink or dinner with your friends?**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer is &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; to at least half of these questions, then perhaps it’s time you took some measures before it gets too serious. If you believe the situation is already very serious, then you should look for professional help. In any case, here are some simple things you could try if you have recognized the signs of a workaholic in yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. Restrict yourself from working longer hours. This is probably much easier said than done, but there are some things you could do to help yourself through this process. Whenever possible, try to schedule free-time activities immediately after standard working hours. Scheduling a meeting with your friends, or a family dinner, or simple training in a gym with your friend or personal trainer might help a lot. These kind of activities will force you to leave your office every day at approximately the same time. Not only will you work less hours, but also your productivity will boost knowing you have to complete that same amount of work with less hours available. On the emotional side, you will feel better as well, knowing that you will spend more time with friends and family, or just simply exercising or doing things you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Switch your mobile phone to the silent or vibrate mode during dinner hours and learn to check your email box at certain times of the day. Try to spend more time with your spouse or kids. Once you are emotionally recharged, your work results will be better as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Organize your shorter work hours in a better way utilizing different time management techniques and learn how to delegate parts of your duties to your employees or co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, learn how to better unwind at the end of the day and plan on your free time. Relaxation and time with friends will definitely help you re-charge your batteries and attack your job problems and issues with more energy and fresh new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule's Highlights</title>
   <link href="/blog/nimbleschedules-highlights/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-19T10:45:28-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/nimbleschedules-highlights</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule is an employee scheduling cloud software based on the Microsoft Azure platform. By utilizing the latest technology and trends, our development team went an extra mile in securing the reliability and speed of our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you use Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Safari, all the functionalities and features are available to you. Often times companies do not pay much attention to cross-browser compatibility and focus just on one or two browsers. Our team went into the completely opposite direction by ensuring cross-browser compatibility with all the well-known browsers. By doing so, we covered not only employees with older computers but also users of diverse OS platforms like Windows, MacOS and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nimbleschedule-highlights.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nimbleschedule-highlights-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NimbleSchedule&#39;s highlights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, NimbleSchedule is also available via smart phone apps. Currently, we are supporting Android and iPhone (iOS) systems. Employees can download our smart phone apps at no additional charge and use them from home, office or on the road in order to access their schedule or pick up open shifts. Furthermore, if a company decides to allow its employees to clock in by using our smart phone apps, they will be able to use the time attendance feature through their phone as well. As a result, managers and administrators will get to see employees’ GPS stamps when they clocking-in, which is great because the company management will always know where their employees really are and what they are doing at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully understanding and following the market needs, NimbleSchedule has enriched its time attendance module with Phone call clock-in and SMS clock-in options, thus offering companies with employees having no computers the most efficient time attendance solution. Although these additional features come at a minor extra charge, they ensure amazing flexibility when it comes to the end-user / employee usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to a rise of interest in the time attendance/time clock module, we have also expanded our list of  supported fingerprint scanners for employees’ clocking in/out. With the latest additions to our list of supported devices and methods, we significantly expanded our support for corporate event planning companies and all those niche industries with outdoor workers like construction companies. On top of this amazing functionality, we also provide the QR Code Card functionality that works with Android and iPad tablets. By using a QR Code Card, employees can now clock in by using a designated tablet clock post, where all they need to do is flash their QR Code in front of the tablet, click the button in the middle of the screen and they will be clocked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the fact that we have enabled the integration with a wide range of 3rd party systems, our users can integrate all those systems into one big and well oiled machine supporting their businesses. At this moment, we are supporting the integration with the companies like BambooHR, Zenpayroll, ADP, Quickbooks Online, Lightspeed, etc. Having our intuitive set of API methods at their disposal, other companies started integrating with our system as well. Systems like Trax Payroll or SimplePay have made sure that NimbleSchedule gets integrated with their payroll systems natively. Our development team continues to work on adding new partnering systems as an extension of our intuitive scheduling tool to the benefit of all our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rapidly developing system can handle all sorts of employee requests and entries. Whether through one of our partnering systems that provides sales and HR services, or payroll systems that make running payroll reports super easy and intuitive, NimbleSchedule is the glue that bides all these systems in one place and provides an amazing interface where all the data come in and get processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our feature-rich reporting system makes a clear distinction between us and our competitors, providing many different reports through which employee productivity or costing is now very easy to track. All those reports are available in real time and just one click of a mouse away when you are a NimbleSchedule customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue working on new functionalities and additions to our system to your benefit. Our goal is to empower you to easily control your company costs and schedules. The fast growing client base is telling us that we are doing it the right way. If you would like to share your thoughts and ideas with us, please do not hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us and send us your opinion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Holiday Countdown – Get Ready for Christmas</title>
   <link href="/blog/holiday-countdown/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-18T10:55:27-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/holiday-countdown</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christmas is just around the corner! Is your business ready for holiday shoppers and an increase in demand? A wise person would say that preparations for Christmas should start months earlier, especially with some marketing campaigns that might need some while to be picked up by your current or potential customers. So, hopefully, by now, you have set all your long term plans to work for you, and you are ready for the final countdown and last minute adjustments or changes. Here are some last minute things to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/merry-christmas.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/merry-christmas-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Get Ready for Christmas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)	Do you have enough employees to work in your store or customer support service for the holiday? If you are not sure that your answer is “Yes” here, or if you hesitated to answer, perhaps you should think about hiring another pair of hands just in case? Or, if you manage a large store, having a couple of extra people on stand-by can’t hurt. What if someone calls in sick in the last minute?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)	Are all your employees properly trained for the holiday rush? Do they all know what to do if your POS terminal starts acting up? Or if something else turns up? Go over important things with your employees, especially with those temps that you hired just for the holiday and make sure everyone is well prepared for certain questions or issues. It can never hurt to have a backup for some things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)	Do you have your best employees attending customers? Make sure you have those reliable ones representing your company. You don’t need employees hiding somewhere around the store and texting their friends our checking their Facebook. Have your best and most competent employees handling customers that very day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)	If you need to hire some temporary staff members to help out throughout the holidays, then try first with those who used to work for your company and perhaps left in order to finish their college. They are already trained and skilled, you know them well, so you can probably re-use their skills if they are interested in working some extra hours and making some extra dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5)	Handle your personal matters early, and don’t leave gift shopping for the last day. If possible, ask your employees to do that as well, because you probably don’t want to leave your business or to have your employees leave your store or office at Christmas running around to buy a gift. Complete that task upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these strictly operational things, there are lot of other things to consider before the holiday. Will you be giving some gifts or discounts for Christmas? What about your loyal clients, will they get some extra benefits? Are your best products with major discounts placed on the best spots around the store so everyone can see them? Have you stocked your supplies on time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/merry-christmas2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/merry-christmas2-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you operate a website, then have your designer spice up the graphics on your website. Have that Christmas spirit spread around your store or the website and set the mood for your customers and clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/email-marketing/&quot;&gt;email list&lt;/a&gt; consisting of your most loyal customers is a great thing to use around Christmas as well. Use your list to notify your loyal customers about the discounts and offers you will have for the holiday. Remind them you are here for them during the holidays as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, plan your every move. Prepare everyone and re-check more than once if everyone is clear on what they are supposed to do. Do some minor last minute adjustments and leave nothing to chance. Having the whole team working as a well oiled machine is a perfect strategy for the line of customers that might step into your store during Christmas time or that might start calling your support line.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Fund Your Small Business</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-fund-your-small-business/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-14T09:51:42-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-fund-your-small-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Small businesses are of utmost importance for a country’s economy. Being a source of an economic recovery in the times of crises, not only do they hire the majority of people but they also serve large companies on multiple levels, enabling big industry players to operate their business without any interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most of the small businesses start as a one man’s idea, the path from just an idea to a successful realization is not so easy and may have many bumps along the road. All such ideas require initial capital to fund the actual realization of initial plans and fund your small business until profitability is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to get funding for a small business? Here are some of the most common ways for raising small business fund capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest personal assets in your business.&lt;/strong&gt; Very often, startup entrepreneurs decide to invest their own capital and savings into their business ideas. As a beginner, attracting sponsors and investors may be an extremely difficult task, so funding your own ideas or involving into partnerships is probably the best way to get you started. Along the way, when the time gets right to request funding from angel investors, the fact that you have your personal assets invested may be an excellent foundation to build trust with your potential investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/invest-in-small-business.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/invest-in-small-business-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Funding your small business&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family and friends investments.&lt;/strong&gt; What comes as an intuitive solution when additional funding of your business ideas is needed is to reach out to the ones closest to you: your family and friends. While borrowing or raising funds from your family members or closest friends may sound as the best solution at that particular moment, there are certain things you should consider prior to taking this approach. What happens if your business idea fails? Will you ruin the relationship with your closest friends and relatives? So think this idea through all the way, and propose an honest and trustworthy deal. Seek legal advice and instruct them to look for help as well before engaging in this plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bank or other types of small business loans.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes you may be forced to take on this road as well, no matter if you used any other method, so be aware of the fact that this method requires a lot of work and guarantees from your end. Although there are many companies offering assistance and advice on how to get funding for a small business, this particular approach may require a lot of your attention and paperwork in order to get through. It is the most common one among business owners that need significantly larger funding than the ones that can be raised from friends, relatives or from their personal savings accounts. Unlike with being funded by an investor, by taking a loan you do not actually give away a part of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right investors.&lt;/strong&gt; As opposed to all the previously mentioned methods, this approach requires you to build a lot of personal connections based on trust. Finding an angel investor may be harder than what you think, and it will certainly take a while until you meet the right people interested in investing in your personal company and/or product. Presenting such investors with realistic business forecasts may be of key value for your future cooperation. Attention to details will be of utmost importance when it comes to the realization of such agreements and putting them on paper. Weigh what you will give away and what you will get in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason why people decide to start their own small business company is because it gives them certain independence, so some may find certain methods described here as a limiting factor to their original idea. This article may give you just general ideas regarding start up funding for small business which will certainly be a great starting point. Today’s economy requires business owners to be creative enough to find all the possible funding sources for their businesses, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Job Code Use – Project, Task or Client Specific Tracking</title>
   <link href="/blog/schedule-maker-job-codes/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-13T09:49:50-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/schedule-maker-job-codes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing employee work schedules or time clock entries with NimbleSchedule is extremely simple and easy. You schedule your employees, they clock in and out, and you approve their timesheet records. **But how about using our schedule maker system for a bit more advanced workforce solutions? **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the optional features in NimbleSchedule is the &lt;strong&gt;Job Code functionality&lt;/strong&gt;. By activating the “Enable job codes” option in the Time Clocking section of the Settings you will enable the Job Code functionality for your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you do that, you will notice another option appearing in the Time Clock section of our system labeled as “Job Codes”. That new option will allow you to add new job codes to the system as well as to add an optional description tag for each entry. Later on, all your employees will have a chance to select a proper job code while clocking out, either while using the web panel or their smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Job-Codes.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Job-Codes-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Job Codes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of the “Job Code” field will allow you to track certain projects or tasks and determine the exact number of hours your employees spent for such work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides tracking the task or project information, you could find a different use for the Job Code field as well. For example, in case your employees are serving a list of your clients during their shifts, then you could optionally use the Job Code field to track the exact number of hours and costs attached to each of your clients. These are just some of the ways you could use the job code functionality but, of course, you could find your best fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from tracking the job code data on your employee timesheeets, there are some reports in NimbleSchedule that allow you to have an overview of the job code usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**One of those reports, and probably the most important one in our schedule maker system, is the Payroll Report. If needed, you could include the job code field in your payroll report as well, by selecting it in the section for additional columns to include into your company’s payroll report.**

Furthermore, you could even group your payroll report per job code, which will enable monitoring of the relevant information grouped for your specific job codes. This kind of feature will allow you to easily track staffing costs and the number of hours spent on performing such tasks and assignments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>How to Build Customer Loyalty</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-build-customer-loyalty/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-13T08:46:42-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-build-customer-loyalty</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all know that nowadays getting new customers is very hard whereas maintaining the existing ones should be an easier task. Some studies show that maintaining a good relationship with your returning clients is a lot cheaper than gaining new ones. With some industry niches, returning customers can generate more than 80% of sales, so going an extra mile to invoke customer loyalty may pay off in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, we have selected some of the most useful tips for creating customer loyalty:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate with your customers as often as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Sending an email to customers, or communicating with them through social media or any other means of communication can make them feel appreciated by your company. This type of communication doesn’t necessarily need to be an advertisement each time. You should always try to add some value to your communication with customers by providing them with some interesting information, discount coupons or notification about a new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good customer service could be the key to your success.&lt;/strong&gt; Some studies show that besides the product quality, customers recognize good customer service as the next best thing to have. By having a team of polite and friendly workers covering your customer support needs, you can significantly improve the first impression about your company or your products. With that being said, your support members need to be well trained and knowledgeable about your product or service and address customers’ issues or questions quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to make your communication with clients sound personal.&lt;/strong&gt; If a customer name is available to you or your support team, then always use it when communicating with them. No matter if that communication is in the form of an email, text message or personal meeting, always address your customers by their name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gift-card.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gift-card-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boost Your Customer Loyalty&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer incentives to your returning customers.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn’t matter what type of a program you decide to apply because incentives can actually make your customers return to your company and buy another product or use another service. Depending on your industry niche, you can use gift cards, offer the buy one – get two free deal or other similar types of programs thus creating customer loyalty .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let your returning customers skip the line.&lt;/strong&gt; No matter if you are in the retail or IT business, let your loyal and returning customers have a special treatment and a possibility to skip the line when it comes to certain requests or purchases. Make them feel special and appreciated and, in return, you will get a loyal customer, ready to come back for more or even ready to recommend your business to others. As mentioned in one of our previous articles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/the-word-of-mouth/&quot;&gt;the word of mouth&lt;/a&gt; can be one of the best marketing tactics, the one that doesn’t cost even close to some other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insist on reliability within your company.&lt;/strong&gt; When you give out promises to customers, make sure you fulfill them. By building a reputation of being reliable, you will show to your clients that your word means something and that they can always rely on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide your loyal customers with an advanced insight into your business.&lt;/strong&gt; If you operate a manufacturing business, allow a group of your loyal customers to visit your production line and see how their favorite products are being made. In case you run a restaurant, have the chef come out once in a while and have a small chat with your returning clients about the meal they just had. They will appreciate the opportunity of being able to speak with the person who just created that delightful meal for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these methods for increasing customer loyalty can be applied in all sorts of industry niches, there are probably certain areas where some of the mentioned steps should be slightly adjusted or even extended. After reading this article we are sure you already have some ideas of your own regarding creating customer loyalty. All in all,  be creative and tie your customers to your brand. The outcomes will be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Social Responsibility – Local and Global Effects</title>
   <link href="/blog/social-responsibility/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-08T07:45:48-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/social-responsibility</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In today’s modern and global economy, companies play an important role in addressing various social and environmental issues. By being socially responsible, companies are becoming a driving force for resolving or helping out numerous social issues, either locally or, quite frequently, globally. By not doing so, companies even risk losing their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what does it mean to be socially responsible? Is it enough to donate annually $100 to one of those organizations raising money for different causes and that’s it,  you have done your part?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an inspiring talk at a TED conference, Fred Swaniker (a Ghanaian-born serial entrepreneur and a brother of NimbleSchedule’s founder - Peter Swaniker) highlighted a personal example of raising global social awareness. Although Mr Swaniker expressed his concerns about political dictatorship regimes in certain African countries, he also presented his revolutionary ideas about helping young people and students across Africa in their attempts to become new leaders that will change their countries and, eventually, the whole continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/fred_swaniker_the_leaders_who_ruined_africa_and_the_generation_who_can_fix_it?language=en&quot;&gt;Fred Swaniker: The leaders who ruined Africa, and the generation who can fix it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his passionate talk about his beloved Africa, Mr Swaniker presented some of the problems in which many recognized other regions around the globe as well. Building societies with strong civilian control and reputable institutions is a task that may last for decades or sometimes even centuries, but it seems that for some countries or regions in the world this is the one step forward – two steps back story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting more people to believe in right goals is the mission that lies before all of us. Overwhelmed with daily work tasks, do we have enough time to think about the social issues affecting our local communities, not to mention certain nasty situations that are happening in countries that may be far away from our every day talks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By playing an active role on both the political and social scene, companies and their leaders and employees have an impact on the world we live in. Even though people tend to consider large corporations as being greedy and not thinking enough about social and environmental issues, it appears that there are more and more corporations and individuals speaking for the right cause. Whether we are talking about gathering food or clothes for the homeless, or encouraging democracy in the third world countries, the progress is more than visible. What is especially encouraging is the fact that young people have become more involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-can-your-company-help-spread-awareness&quot;&gt;How can your company help spread awareness?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, there are many ways in which companies and their employees can accelerate the whole process and develop better social awareness in communities and/or societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By motivating employees to do their best while performing their work tasks and exploiting their expertise and competence, companies may achieve much better results in their effort to be socially responsible either on a local or global level. For example, by using 50 IT experts to collect garbage for 8 hours in a park, you can achieve wonderful results, but could we use 400 IT specialist hours for achieving even better result through various online activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering concrete help through the use of your company’s product or service is yet another great way to help organizations or individuals fighting for the right cause. One of those examples is NimbleSchedule’s discount offered to all non-profit organizations based on any payment term. This is a practice which is not limited just to us as a lot of other socially responsible companies are helping in similar ways with their products or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, donating cash to certain organizations or organizing fundraising events is the right step to do as well. Although volunteering hours or resources is extremely useful, for some causes a financial donation is the best way to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe that all these different organizations and activities are getting us closer towards the goal of having healthier and socially responsible communities around the world. Are you ready to contribute to this cause?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Effective Conversion: From a Visitor to a Customer</title>
   <link href="/blog/effective-conversion/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-05T10:35:43-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/effective-conversion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes having a great product or service may not be enough so finding the winning formula to present the right information to your website visitors may hold the key to your success. Improving your conversion rates and getting them to a higher level requires a lot of attention to details. It is not just enough to put any kind of a website online – you need to present your information in the best possible way. There are always ways to improve on your strategy, even if you are already doing well, so here we will present some of those valuable tricks you might find useful for increasing conversation rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove unnecessary distractions. Keep in mind that very often – less is more. So is there really a need for advertisements and badges all around your website? Focus on the most important part of your business or service, and get straight to the point. Add a short explanation, a call-to-action, mention available discounts and offer useful tips. With a colorful and easy to use design that is probably all you will need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add value to your offer. Don’t just simply invite visitors to register or buy your product. Inform them about the key advantages of your product or service and clearly highlight what they will get if they decide to purchase or subscribe with your website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay away from too much content and too long descriptions. If you really need to add a long description that goes with your product or service, try to add it on a separate page or add it as a PDF link available for downloading. Although a lot of people are tempted to add more content to their website thinking they will be better positioned by search engines, having too much content on your pages may lower your conversion rates. Find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add targeted content. Try to analyze what people were searching for when they came to your web pages and optimize your content accordingly. If you are using different advertising campaigns with different audience types, then try to create different landing pages with targeted content and slightly different approaches and/or descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimize your home page in the right way. If possible, add your picture or real customer testimonials with their images, which will leave a better impression on the visitor and increase the sense of a personal touch. Whenever possible, add a background with images of real people or real customers, which will definitely soften a cold looking plain web page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/success-stories.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/success-stories-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Success Stories - Happy Customers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put a call-to-action link in the center of the page. Provide a short description and add a call-to-action button with a slightly larger font and make it easily readable for everyone. If you are getting a lot of visitors from mobile phones or tablets, then test in detail how your website looks and works from those devices. Keep in mind that the overall number of smart phone and tablet users is rapidly increasing in the world. Keep up with technology improvements and standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add live chat to your website. Although this may require a lot of attention from your support team members, the live chat feature is proven to increase conversion rates. Often times visitors will not need the offered live chat support but be sure that having this feature available will be appreciated. That way they will always be able to contact you in case they need clarification or help, which is a perfect way to create trust which is a key ingredient needed for converting a visitor into a paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore various tactics until you find the best model of how to increase conversation rate. There is no universal solution for all niches or companies. So experiment with all the above mentioned tips or select just a few until you find the optimal balance for your needs. Having effective conversion rates will clearly lead your company to the path of success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>How to Increase Brand Awareness</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-increase-brand-awareness/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-02T09:47:03-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-increase-brand-awareness</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marketing tactics have dramatically changed over the last decade, especially with the growth of the social media market and new technology improvements. The task of reaching out to your targeted audience and measuring brand awareness has become increasingly challenging, despite more and more available online tools and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/brand.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/brand-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Measuring Brand Awareness&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to create better brand awareness within your targeted market? Are there any useful tips and tricks that can save us money and provide a better outcome? Let’s take a look at some of the most efficient ways to increase brand awareness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create sharable content.&lt;/strong&gt; Give your target audience a reason to share your opinions and thoughts and do your marketing job for you. With an increase of social media network users, this step may become a very important one for your business. Creating an effective title for your content and some valuable tips for the industry may prove valuable to your audience reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a personal touch to your business awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Your customers should see that you are not a corporate robot and that you do have an intriguing personality. Staying within the professional boundaries, feel free to experiment with your approach to market and your audience and do not be afraid to step out with honest opinions and bring some personality to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide excellent customer support.&lt;/strong&gt; The most important thing after the product’s price and quality is the customer service. Your clients or prospects may have some questions about the product or service you offer and their first impression of your customer service may set a ground for their overall impression of your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read and listen through social media, don’t just post.&lt;/strong&gt; Take some time to carefully read comments and posts made by your current group fans or your competitors. Posting quality content is important, but reading what others say about your business and about your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses could greatly benefit for your approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay in touch with the market.&lt;/strong&gt; Although creating a brand name is important, maintaining a contact with your target audience is of equal importance as well. Stay in touch with your clients and prospects by occasionally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/email-marketing/&quot;&gt;sending them a newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; post or any other means of communication just to remind them you are still here, or else you might get forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write blog articles with valuable content.&lt;/strong&gt; Spoil your audience by providing them with valuable articles about what they want to know or learn. Turn your occasional website visitors into followers and try to deliver the content on a regular basis. Although some of them may not be your actual customers, you would like to help them associate you with your industry niche. This is valuable on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the same logo on all fronts.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to make your brand recognizable, create an effective logo and use it in all fields of your interaction with prospects and clients, including social media, blog articles, etc. Even if you have an excellent graphics designer on hand, who can create 10 stunning logos for your brand, try to choose one and stick to it. Make it recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Business and Parenting</title>
   <link href="/blog/parenting-and-business/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-30T11:06:52-08:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How many times did it happen that after a hard working day you finally got to see your family and your kids, and all of a sudden in the middle of the dinner you remembered some working task you should have completed that day but completely forgot about it? If that task somehow involved an important client or your employees, then you definitely had an excuse to excuse yourself from the dinner table and leave to finish your important task. However, by the time you were done your kids had already fallen asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the work never ends, and no matter how many different tasks you manage to complete by the end of your working day, there is always something from work on your mind. If you start dedicating yourself too much to your work and spending less and less time with your kids and family, will they grow apart from you? Will they feel underappreciated, especially when they compare themselves with your work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/business-and-parenting.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/business-and-parenting-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Balancing work and family&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing work and family may be the key for good parenting and good business handling. Being a good leader does not necessarily have to mean you need to spend less time with your children. While many will argue that you can never strictly separate your business from your private life, there are always certain measures you can take to create a better balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a workaholic, then you might find it hard to leave certain tasks to others to complete, but sometimes that can become a necessity especially if you want to keep your relationship with your kids and dedicate more time to them. As a company leader or manager you do not need to micro-manage everything. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/&quot;&gt;Delegate certain tasks to your employees&lt;/a&gt; and just supervise the execution, thus relieving yourself from all those not so crucial company tasks and eventually gain more time for your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, start to get up earlier in the morning and complete some tasks before your kids are even awake. Make the most of your lunch breaks and spend them with your kids, or get out of work earlier than you usually do and pick up your kids after school or see them play their important basketball game. Attending important events for your kids will definitely create and maintain the healthy bond between you, but may also charge you with more positive energy that will reflect on all fronts, including at your work if the work means a lot to you. So you won’t be losing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseeing some of employees’ activities by using your mobile phone or tablet may also help you a lot in such situations. With the advancement of technology a lot of work can nowadays be handled through Internet, especially by using various cloud based services, such as Dropbox - file sharing or NimbleSchedule - SaaS employee scheduling. Have your to-do list in your cell phone and complete certain tasks on the go. This will save you a lot of time that you can dedicate to your child or your spouse. Use the technology to your benefit and create more free time by utilizing all possible gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that balancing work and family is a matter of choice. If there is a will, there is always a way. Be creative with as many work duties as you can so that you could gain more time for your family. Try to dedicate at least one evening during the week to your kids, and spend some time talking or playing with them, or simply take them to see some movie. Make that a weekly habit and your kids will remember that till the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cold calling</title>
   <link href="/blog/cold-calling/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-28T10:14:17-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/cold-calling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While opinions on cold calling vary and may be completely opposite among prominent sales experts, there are certain experts that claim this method can be a valuable addition to your company’s sales efforts. As with all other marketing and sale tactics, there are certain cold calling skills that will help you close more deals and find new customers and clients for your business. In this article,  we will try to mention the important ones thus helping you master the art of cold calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cald-calling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cald-calling-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cold Calling Skills&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepare well and go through the list of prospects.&lt;/em&gt; Do not spend too much time on this, but try to obtain some relevant information about your prospects. Any kind of information could come handy here. Write down your findings on the list and try calling people with similar profiles to the ones you already had some success with. This is the part where profiling your prospects in the right way may represent a distinction between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use a brief, well prepared, sales script.&lt;/em&gt; It is very important to leave a good first impression, because you might not get the second chance. The first couple of seconds are very important, so try to sound polite and confident in what you are saying. Bring up the facts and try to get them interested in your offer. That’s all you might need for that initial contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus on the purpose of the call.&lt;/em&gt; All you need to do during that first call is to get your prospect interested in your offer and, without too many details, try to set an appointment or a second call where you could try to sell your product or service. Do not try to make a sale during your first call with the prospect. Your goal should be just to get them interested and to schedule another sales appointment or call where you could actually sell them your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try to get through to the decision maker.&lt;/em&gt; If the other party agrees to talk, give your best to try to determine whether or not that person is a decision maker in that company or household. If you are out of luck and the person you are talking to is not a decision maker, then do not just simply cut off. They might be able to provide you with an insight on when the actual decision maker would be available for a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be prepared for objections.&lt;/em&gt; Almost every call will include at least one or two objections, so be prepared for them. Try to think of some good reasons and excuses for as many objections as you can and be well prepared when that happens. Don’t waste too much time on explanations, though. Be direct and straight to the point. Address the objection and propose an appointment again through which you could discuss more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep a positive and confident tone.&lt;/em&gt; Set a mood from the start and keep it positive. Do not appear as too excited and hyper to the prospect, because people tend to be skeptic towards things that sound too good or too positive to be true. Keep the positive spirit and use an energetic voice. Be confident about your offer and make them believe you are doing them a favor by offering your great product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Always agree to the appointment time that suits the prospect.&lt;/em&gt; Whatever time they mention for a possible second call or an appointment, agree to it straight away. Once you get their permission to contact them, you will have a chance to re-schedule later on, in case that initial the term doesn’t suit your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeat this process as often as possible.&lt;/em&gt; Keep in mind that practice makes perfect, so repeat this process on a daily basis in order to refine the art of cold calling. Be persistent. If possible, try to keep some statistics or reports about previous prospects, which can help you analyze your results and mistakes, regroup and fight for your success.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Email marketing</title>
   <link href="/blog/email-marketing/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-25T10:33:36-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/email-marketing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the increase of social media marketing, email marketing suffered quite a blow in the last couple of years. However, we still believe that email marketing is one of the best ways to reach your audience and present your product or newsletter. The challenging part is how to get as many people open and read your email as possible. There is no purpose in sending out long, boring emails and ending up in everyone’s JUNK box, is there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right way to do it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/newsletter.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/newsletter-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Email Marketing Systems&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep ‘em short and straight to the point.&lt;/em&gt; Although there is no official limit regarding the length of the text you can send via email, do keep in mind that people do not necessarily want to read a novel instead of an email. More and more people have started reading their emails from their smart phones and tablets, which makes it even harder for them to read long emails. If you really need to provide them with a longish text, you can always send them a link instead and direct them to a relevant tutorial, manual or an e-book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Address your reader by his name.&lt;/em&gt; If available to you, include as much personal information you have about your reader as you can. By making an email sound as personal as it can be, you increase the chance of having it being read by the receiving party and you increase the chance of making that important connection with the reader. Assuming that you probably have the name of the person you are emailing, then always choose to start an email with “Hello John!” instead of “Dear reader” because such small tricks can make the reader feel more comfortable with your message and he may have a feeling that you are addressing him personally and not just some general audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the marketing and sales tone to a minimum.&lt;/em&gt; People consider their Inbox folder as their personal space and may not react in a positive way when they receive a message with a hard marketing or sales tone. If you sell a product, then sell it through your website, Amazon or any other online or offline store, do not do that through email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add value to your email messages.&lt;/em&gt; Whenever possible, try to add some value to your email messages. Get to know your audience as much as you can and provide them with what they actually need. Depending on the type of your email marketing list, include some useful tips or discounts. Sometimes it is better to send one good email message that many people will read than five emails in a row which almost no one will open or read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write effective subject lines.&lt;/em&gt; In order to get the reader actually open your email message, your subject line must be appealing and interesting. Try to invoke the reader’s curiosity and spend some time thinking about the most effective subject line before sending out your message. If possible, let your subject line be a short introduction to the content itself, but make it sound interesting! No one wants to read boring emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid images and too many links.&lt;/em&gt; Recent statistics show that emails with embedded images are frequently avoided. As already mentioned, people consider their email accounts as their private space, and they do not necessarily want to see a link to a website page within their email message. Moreover, with strict spam filters being applied by most popular email marketing systems, emails containing a large number of links are being automatically discarded, even though they might be quite legitimate messages that people actually do want to read. So try to keep the number of links to a minimum (1-2 per email). Note that the unsubscribe link also counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send emails at appropriate times.&lt;/em&gt; The maximum effect will be achieved if you send an email to people in the morning hours or near the end of their work time. Unless there is something really urgent, you should not send an email in the middle of the night. In case you manage a list of international users across different time zones, then try to split that list into parts and send a message to a group of your users at the most appropriate time for their respective time zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there could be many more items to add to the list of these tips, we strongly believe that the ones listed here are the ones that should be enforced whenever possible in order to gain more email marketing leads. Depending on the size of your list, another great option that would be appreciated by your readers would be the possibility for them to reply. But if you manage a list of 10,000 people or more that may be hard to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy marketing!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips for Team Building</title>
   <link href="/blog/team-building-tips/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-23T10:37:41-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/team-building-tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to improve communication and trust among team members, companies started experimenting with various team building ideas and techniques long time ago. Since there is no single recipe on how to produce a better and more productive working environment, we’ll present you with a mix of team building tips that will help you achieve those goals along with some truisms related to team building itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team building improves communication in your team.&lt;/em&gt; There is always room for the improvement of the communication within your company. Whether we are talking about communication between two employees or between employees and management, various team building techniques can improve mutual relationships and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/team-building.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/team-building-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Team Building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team building cuts down the gap between employees and management.&lt;/em&gt; Through these team building games and practices, managers get an opportunity to socialize with their employees and present themselves as being one of them. This approach minimizes the gap between the company management and employees. Furthermore, this process makes employees more relaxed in the presence of their managers and enables a better flow of ideas and arguments within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employee motivation rises.&lt;/em&gt; By increasing trust in your employees and showing them that it’s not everything and always about the work, employees get better motivated to perform their tasks when the time comes. Taking them somewhere outdoors or allowing them to have some fun within the company’s premises improves the working spirit and working environment in your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boosting of tolerance and self-criticism.&lt;/em&gt; Improved relations among your team members boosts tolerance within the team itself and cuts down on tension between employees. Minimizing stress in your team improves your company’s working surrounding and prevents all kinds of conflicting situations which are inevitable in larger teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helps managers discover desirable characteristics.&lt;/em&gt; Sometimes employees are engaged in their monotonous daily work routines thus not being able to exhibit certain skills and competencies for other types of work.  Nice socializing through games and practices may help them relax and show their true face, the more creative one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team building helps self-initiative and self-assurance.&lt;/em&gt; Certain team building tips and techniques can help improve employees’ self-assurance as well as their self-initiative through various work activities, especially if we are talking about newbies. Great leaders are not great just because of their personal skills, but because the team behind them is great as well. Hence, good leaders should always nurture self-initiative within the team and help their team members boost their confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helps development of problem-solving skills.&lt;/em&gt; In almost any industry niche, the time sometimes comes when problems need to be fixed urgently. This is exactly the type of a situation where good team work can overcome anything. A well organized and synchronized team can re-group quickly, re-assign duties and start working instantly on resolving certain issues. On the other hand, this is a situation where bad team organization and spirit can break up and collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promotes creative thinking.&lt;/em&gt; Letting your employees socialize and think outside the box promotes creative thinking in their working place as well. Even though you may be an amazing entrepreneur with excellent ideas and organization, ten heads can always come up with better ideas than just one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Builds trust.&lt;/em&gt; Besides working together, having some fun and entertaining time together helps boost trust between you as the owner or manager and your team members. The increase of trust improves the working environment and intensifies efforts towards accomplishing any task. Remember, with a happy and well oiled team behind you – you are sure to achieve your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Remote working</title>
   <link href="/blog/remote-working/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-21T10:02:22-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/remote-working</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the development of modern technology, remote working is no longer just a theory, it has become a reality. Nowadays a large number of employees work from their homes for the benefits of both themselves and their companies. Depending on the exact industry niche, this may be a more or less spread practice among start-up companies and there are certainly many pros and cons that are to be taken into valuation when thinking about remote work opportunities. 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/working-from-home.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/working-from-home-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Remote Work Opportunities&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with highlighting some of the advantages of remote working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt;: Cost reduction on multiple levels. Paying for offices and other expenses may not be so cheap, especially if your company hires more than just a couple of employees. Add electricity and other bills to that amount, and the sum adds up pretty quickly. By having your employees work from their homes you may need to cover just part of those expenses (like phone bills or different collaboration tools) but you get to save a lot on offices and furniture. On top of that, employees save a lot on commuting as they don’t have to travel to their offices every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt;: Better time effectiveness. Employees save a lot of time they would usually spend on traveling to and back from work. Furthermore, some people spend a lot of time preparing for going to work. This may consume even up to an hour or more. Working from home saves all this time and employees can use it more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt;: Less impact on environment. With less traveling, people make less impact on environment. Environmental pollution caused by human actions should not be ignored. Therefore, anything that we, as a society can do to reduce it should be welcomed. Less commute means less pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt;: Productivity increases. With less things around you to disturb you, the peace and tranquility of your home provides an excellent surrounding to focus better on your work and increase your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt;: Significantly better employee selection. With access to experts and talents from wider areas, or even different countries, you gain access to some niche experts that you probably wouldn’t be able to find in your local area or perhaps it would take you a lot more time to find. By hiring remote workers with right skills, you can even increase the quality of your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the downsides of working remotely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Con&lt;/em&gt;: Harder communication. With employees across different time zones and working hours, the communication between your team members gets harder. With this in mind, companies that do hire employees should invest more in certain online tools that help remote teams share ideas, project details, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Con&lt;/em&gt;: Trust issues. Without direct supervision, this method may cause some trust issues between your different team members or between managers, on one side, and employees on the other. Some may argue that team members without direct supervision may also provide a lower work quality, which is not a widely accepted opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Con&lt;/em&gt;: Social isolation. Without face-to-face interaction with other co-workers, the remote working method may cause social isolation between people working such jobs, which raises some concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without an attempt to make a definitive conclusion on your behalf, both pros and cons should be taken into consideration when thinking about your specific approach to this topic. Depending on the exact industry niche or other factors, you may  or may not find remote working suitable for you. In any case, as there are countless remote work opportunities why not giving it a try?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Webinars</title>
   <link href="/blog/webinars/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-17T09:23:05-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/webinars</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Web seminars, or shortly called webinars, are a modern tool used by a lot of companies for holding online conferences or for training. Especially popular in the software industry, webinars can be used to present your software to the audience by sharing your screen at the same time showing your product and communicating with one or more of your potential clients without having to travel somewhere, rent a presentation room or office or waste your precious time on traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/online-presentations.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/online-presentations-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Online presentations - Webinars&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A webinar is a powerful tool in the hands of an experienced sales agent, especially in situations when they have an interesting party for their product. An agent can use the web conference tools to share his screen, show off the product by highlighting the best characteristics and features and gain a prospective client’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of frequently mentioned benefits of using webinar tools is the re-usability of such recorded content. You can use previously recorded webinars to post on your website for other potential customers to watch and listen to, or to share them with your new employees as part of their training process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, in order for a potential client to request a webinar, they need to fill out a form on the website and select a preferred time. If a person made an effort to do that, we can easily assume that they are very interested and in need of a product like the one you offer. Having an opportunity to present all your product characteristics to that prospect is a huge benefit for an experienced sales person, especially when knowing that they are definitely in need of such a product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big advantage of a webinar use is that you can actually show your product or video to an interested party, instead of just telling them about it. Now the client has an opportunity to see the product he is buying instead of just having to visualize it in his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another huge benefit of using a webinar is that it saves you a lot of time. You no longer need to travel across the country to hold a seminar for some big company. All you need is a good Internet connection and proper webinar software and you can line up even a couple of webinars in a row and gain maximum effect with multiple clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using such tools keep in mind that not all your potential customers are technical experts. So give them some time or guidance on how to install proper software on their end in order to join you on that webinar. With some of those most popular webinar tools, this process is made super easy, even for non-techy individuals, so all you are left with is to send a reminder to your prospective client about your online meeting a couple of minutes before it starts and you are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any other means of communication, it is important to prepare well. The better you know your prospect, the higher the chances are you will win that sale. So try to communicate their needs before the webinar so you could prepare yourself more appropriately and focus on their specific issues or questions and how your product would help them overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the webinar give your audience a chance to ask questions or state if they are slightly overwhelmed. If you start hearing such complaints, then the best idea would probably be to split one big webinar into a series of shorter ones, covering specific topics in each. This method may help the client focus better, prepare, and it may give them some time to contemplate on what they previously saw and heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we have mentioned some of the webinar best practices, we will not single out any specific webinar software in this article; however, there are many useful ones out there to try out. Depending on your product and industry niche, you may find some of those tools more or less productive for your specific case. We encourage you to try a couple of different ones and find a perfect fit for you and your sales team. Happy selling!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Protect Data</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-protect-data/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-15T10:19:03-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-protect-data</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No matter if you are trying to protect data on your company computer or your home laptop or desktop, some general rules regarding your data privacy and security should always be applied. If you keep your projects and work related files on your computer, losing such data may be a huge setback for your work or you might even lose your job if that happens at a bad time, for example, when you are preparing to file your report or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/presenting/&quot;&gt;deliver an important presentation&lt;/a&gt; to your clients or supervisors. Thinking about this on time may save you from a lot of headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the above-mentioned in mind, here are some general steps and precautionary measures on how to protect your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/security.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/security-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Data security&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backup your important data.&lt;/strong&gt; This is one of the most important measures. Backup your data to an external location (an additional hard drive, USB stick or CD media) on a regular basis. In case your hard disk crashes abruptly, or your system gets infected by a virus or malware, you will have your important data safely stored off-location on another drive or computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install antivirus protection.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t just leave everything to fate. This is one of those important steps that you can take and that either cost nothing or include a very small fee. With a lot of free antivirus software options around the web, you can definitely pick one that you like and that has good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install firewall protection.&lt;/strong&gt; As with antivirus, there are lots of free firewall applications on the Internet so you can download the one you like most and use it to protect your system from intrusions. On top of those freeware applications, there is a great deal of professional cost-effective options as well as hardware firewalls. Apart from blocking external connections to your computer, the firewall can frequently help you to block some local files from making connections to online destinations. If you see some unknown software trying to connect to the Internet, you can, of course, Google the name of that file and see what that file actually does, but as a precaution you can temporarily block it until you are certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your antivirus and firewall up-to-date.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep all your software and system up-to-date especially when it comes to antivirus, firewall or any other malware detection software. There is a reason why manufacturers release their regular updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not install unnecessary browser toolbars.&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you know with certainty that you need a certain toolbar and you can make use out of it, then simply do not install it. Occasionally when you install freeware software, you will notice that a toolbar that you did not intend to use or install starts appearing in your browser. Try to uninstall such toolbars as soon as possible. Nothing good can come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download software from trusted sources.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to download your new software only from trusted sources. Quite frequently the price of having some software for free is that an additional toolbar or software will be installed to your computer. Keep in mind that good things rarely come for free, so before installing some freeware make sure to read reviews on it or check the source of that software to determine whether or not you can trust it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure strong passwords.&lt;/strong&gt; People frequently configure plain passwords for important access details, like their email accounts, work restricted areas, etc.  This is not a good practice, and such passwords occasionally get hacked. To avoid such unpleasant situations, try to configure strong passwords, wherever possible. Besides numbers and at least one CAPS letter, adding symbols like $ or % can significantly increase the strength of your password and protect your precious data from intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By utilizing a couple of these tips, or all of them, you can significantly increase your data privacy and security. Although sometimes there is nothing you could do when your email gets hacked or your company intranet gets exposed, keeping a frequent backup of your data in place is probably the best idea to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Web Marketing</title>
   <link href="/blog/web-marketing/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-13T10:49:05-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/web-marketing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With over 40% of the world population being connected to the Internet, the significance of web marketing and online presence is huge. Developing a proper online marketing strategy may very easily mean a difference between success and failure in the modern technology world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of years, the form of web marketing  has changed and there are new trends and web marketing solutions for presenting your brand and content to the Internet users. The trends are slowly sliding away from direct web marketing tools like AdWords toward content writing and gaining organic website visitors. Although paid advertising campaigns through such networks may instantly boost sales and increase the number of visitors, companies have started focusing on adding rich website content in order to attract more visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays having a well designed, modern website is a must. From there, as a business owner or manager, you need to develop a good search engine optimization strategy. Pay no attention to those who promise instant results by implementing the so called black-hat techniques. Keep your content fresh and clean as search engines can detect and penalize websites for applying all those tricky web marketing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/web-marketing-solutions.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/web-marketing-solutions-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Web marketing solutions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by promoting your business website and services through Social Networks. The networks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; provide a lot of free web marketing tools through which you can present your company  to a wide audience in the best possible way. In case you need extra attention and you are not patient enough to wait for slow growth of your Facebook business group, you can always use its paid services and rapidly increase your fan group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article and blog writing is an excellent way to promote your website. By writing industry specific news or some entertaining articles, you can also attract visitors to your website. These days a lot of companies utilize this method in order to attract some organic visitors from search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of opt-in email newsletter services is also amazing. Building a large base of users willing to receive occasional newsletter containing product updates or industry news is a powerful resource. At the same time, this method should be properly developed and provide users with an option to opt-out; otherwise, some unsatisfied members from the newsletter list might start reporting your newsletter as spam and you may earn a bad reputation or get blocked by certain email servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing and publishing online press releases is an excellent method to announce important things happening in your company to the general public. There are websites that are specialized in PR publishing and general content publishing so after establishing some connections with such websites and blog owners, you can attract more visitors and potential clients to your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very successful option is building various affiliate or reseller programs. Let other webmasters and business owners do all the work for you and drive you traffic or sales. There are many website owners with visitors and traffic to share, looking for the best matching products to offer to their audience. Do not hesitate to build such a program in order to gain more customers and more sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following one or more of the above mentioned web marketing solutions, you can create an excellent start for your web marketing strategy. Depending on the exact niche of your business, there might be other tips or tricks that you can utilize in order to gain more visitors and  a higher sale rate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Word of Mouth</title>
   <link href="/blog/the-word-of-mouth/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-10T09:01:08-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/the-word-of-mouth</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usually when people move to a new city or a different part of a city, they consult with their new neighbors or friends about the best school, dentist, babysitter or anything else they might need. If you were that person at any time in your life or you were the other side advising a friend or a neighbor about a specific product or service, then you are already aware of the power of the word of mouth marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is vital to maintain a good image and reputation among your customers, this image can rarely be anything else but truth. So the most important part is to have a good product or an excellent service. If your company provides them, then you have a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-power-of-word-of-mouth.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-power-of-word-of-mouth-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Word of mouth marketing strategy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, you have a good product or you offer an amazing service, now what? Leaving everything to chance is a bit naïve tactic. While indeed it is not you but others who need to spread a good word about your company, there are numerous ways of encouraging them to indirectly help you while carrying out your word of mouth marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advancement of the Internet and Social Networks in particular, this process became a lot easier. All you need to do is leave such a good impression on your clients that they will become interested in following your company via Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. As soon as they start following your company or writing any comments, all their friends will see those comments coming from the source they personally know and trust. As you can see, the power of word of mouth on the web is extremely powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping some kind of connection, at least through social networks, can be of great benefit for your business. However, you need to put some effort in that process. It is not enough just to create a page on some social network and that’s it. Occasionally you have to interact with your past clients, create interesting and engaging posts related to your business or product, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to discover people who have a strong influence in their companies or communities. This may require some extra work or time because it is not easy to wow influential people, yet, it may be worth the effort.  Therefore, do some research to find those ideal people that have a major influence over your targeted demographics. Once you do find out such info, you can make an additional effort to leave a good impression on such people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the success of this tactics depends on whether or not people trust your brand. So you really need to make your company stand out in some way. This can be done only if you have an exceptional product or a service coming at a reasonable pricing. Although there are companies that base their word of mouth marketing strategy on offering cheap yet poor quality products, it is always advised to provide good and quality products at reasonable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, try to conduct a poll with some of your clients, or at least friends or employees about your product or brand. Promise them anonymity and then go through those honest opinions. This process can help you improve your weak points and strike back with a better product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Can Facebook be good for your business?</title>
   <link href="/blog/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-08T10:25:11-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/can-facebook-be-good-for-your-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the rapid popularization of social networks, the way business is handled is being transformed as well. More than ever, people use Facebook and other social networks to read reviews and comments of both known and unknown people about products and experiences with various firms. With this in mind, companies can greatly benefit from the advantages of Facebook marketing in the form of free or paid exposure on this social network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/facebook-marketing.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/facebook-marketing-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook marketing benefits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2013, Facebook reported to have over 1,230 million of active users around the world (that’s 1,23 billion people). With over 750 millions of users logging in through Facebook every day, this is obviously amazing potential to reach out to the right audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a good social media presence may be the key of success. In particular, small business firms have become aware of Facebook marketing benefits. Namely, developing a proper Facebook strategy is an important component of advertisement efforts. Such efforts may come at absolutely no additional cost, using available free tools for establishing a new social media presence and building a successful customer base relationship. Providing your customers with means of communication with your company or ability to track the latest company news and products through Facebook may result in an increment of loyalty and higher returning customer rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many companies may claim that the method of brand building through Facebook and other social media networks may be too slow, it is actually the best way for establishing a connection with your client base. If you are among the ones who have no patience to wait for results yet to come, paid advertisements through Facebook are also an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an amazing set of specific targeting tools, Facebook ads provide you with a way to filter only those users with certain interests. This type of advertisements is a useful method for reaching out to the right audience, and it has significant advantages over other forms, such as TV, radio or newspaper ads. Even if you run a local type of business, you can filter users by the city or state and have the audience with right interests, within a reasonable distance from your actual store location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting your business in a proper manner through a free Facebook profile is the right thing to do, especially since it is free. Yet, it may have a huge negative impact on your potential clients if you were not interested enough to put some effort into presenting your company in the best possible way through the social media. In other words, clients may get a feeling that you don’t care that much about your image. Hence keep in mind that by presenting your company in an appropriate way through frequent interesting posts, among other actions, you can show that you do care about how people see your business and what your current and past clients think of your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might say that small companies benefit the most from their Facebook presence and the tools which Facebook provides; however, big industry players are not completely unaware of social media impact so they invest a significant portion of their marketing funds in social media advertising. The good thing is that the tools that were once available only to those large companies are now available to anyone through the social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no more excuses now that you’ve been presented with some Facebook marketing benefits! Your potential clients might be searching for some of your products or services through Facebook this very moment. Will they be able to find your business there properly presented?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Investing Techniques</title>
   <link href="/blog/investing-techniques/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-06T09:45:58-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/investing-techniques</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the US investor Warren Buffet, the so-called ‘Wizard of Omaha’, was ranked by Forbes magazine as the richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $62 billion. His philosophy to investing is as follows: “The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market’s fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in human nature to desire more. While the conventional approach teaches us that there is no money without work, the reason of which the majority of people work, there are other ways of making money. Putting your money to work for you by investing it into certain stocks or bonds is the right way to make more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/best-investment-methods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/best-investment-methods-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Investment Methods &amp;amp; Techniques&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the conventional approach, in order to have more money, you would have to either search for a better paid job or work more hours. However, there is a limit on the number of hours you can really work per day. On the other hand, if you set yourself for too many working hours per week, you will not have that leisure to enjoy benefits that your well earned money brings to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you decide to invest money in buying stocks, bonds, mutual funds or start your own company, the principle is similar. Investing your money in the right niche and in the right company is one of the best investment methods. Unless you wish to gamble and invest your funds somewhere blindly, there are certain investment techniques and analysis approaches that are widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss two widely known investment approaches:
-	Fundamental style of investing
-	Technical style of investing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many investors focus on a specific company and disregard the niche industry factors. By doing so, they do not need to have a wide knowledge or analyze the whole niche industry in order to invest. It is enough to have some common logic and analyze company’s performance. This type of investment is called the Fundamental style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the previously mentioned style, there are certain investors who follow the niche industry. With this kind of investment, they do not analyze performance of a specific company, but rather the whole industry performance. Although this may not sound as the most logical approach, many well known investors use this specific technique, which is called the Technical style of investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both investment techniques have pros and cons, combining them whenever possible is probably one of the best investment methods, but at the same time the most time consuming one.  Depending on your general knowledge and available time to dedicate to these topics and aspects, you may use your own approach and mix and match certain aspects of all the available styles. Whether you want to look at market trends and patterns or analyze specific stocks from individual companies depends on your chosen approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forming investment clubs is another approach that many people take. In order to gain more investment funds you may decide to form an investment club (or join one already formed). You can do this with a selected group of people, either your friends, co-workers, relatives or any business partners. After sorting out all legal aspects and writing down the proper Partnership Agreement you are ready to start with investments. Again, choosing the right approach is the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering taxation percentages, you will notice that governments usually favor investing as opposed to trading. If you decide to invest your money in a company for a period over 12 months, according to the US tax laws, your taxation percentage may vary between 5 - 15 % depending on certain factors. If you, for example, retain stocks for a period less than 12 months, your tax percentage on capital gain may go up to 36%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning ahead in attempt to ensure your financial stability and safe retirement is up to you. With more and more countries slowly switching responsibility from themselves to individuals, it is up you to secure your peaceful future by investing your earnings in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Run NimbleSchedule in Your Own Instance of Microsoft Azure</title>
   <link href="/blog/microsoft-azure-instance/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-06T04:46:03-08:00</updated>

   <title>Business Travel</title>
   <link href="/blog/business-travel-tips/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-03T06:48:53-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/business-travel-tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you spend a lot of time traveling as part of your job, then you have probably already developed some kind of a routine that helps you organize better. Still, we are sure you will find some of our business travel tips helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a checklist. Even when you do not have a lot of things to remember or carry, a travel checklist might help you prepare better. No matter how long or short your travel checklist is, try to make a routine out of following it. That way you will not forget to pack some important stuff you might need on your business trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/business-travel.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/business-travel-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Traveling tips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign up for travel programs. If you frequently use certain airline companies, try signing up for some of their travel programs. This may help you not only save money in the future but also bypass security checks that others need to go through each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always keep essentials packed. If you often travel, then always keep a spare set of cosmetic and hygienic essentials packed and ready to go. You want to spend your spare time relaxing and perhaps sightseeing instead of looking for shops to buy toothpaste or shaving cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pack disposable items whenever possible. By using this method, you will save some room when coming back, especially in case you tend to gain some items during your business trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When traveling abroad, be careful with cell phone rates. Always check the cell phone rates for the area you are traveling to, especially if that includes other countries. Sometimes it may be a lot cheaper to buy a disposable cell phone or to use a phone booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write down the room number. If you travel a lot, there is a big chance that after a while you may start mixing up the room numbers, so try to write down your room number, or record it to your smart phone, if you use one. Although this may sound a little bit silly, it may save you from some inconvenience later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use gadgets whenever possible. With the advancement of technology, there are a lot of different apps for various smart phone systems that can help you navigate through unknown cities, find good hotels or pleasant restaurants with good food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be well prepared, meeting-wise. If possible, try to organize a set of meetings to maximize the benefits of your travel. Not only does traveling cost, but it also takes a lot of time. So always try to prepare the best way you can and have everything aligned for your arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat people politely. Although this sounds cheesy, a kind word to airport personnel or the hotel receptionist may go long way. Remember that those are the positions where frequent complaints are heard throughout the whole day. So a polite and a kind word with an honest compliment may go long way, and may sometimes get you a better airplane seat or a better hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect with locals. Wherever you travel, be friendly with the locals and try to create connections. If nothing better, this will help you learn about other cultures and their habits. On the other hand, it may provide you with some insight into a local market or local business opportunities or contacts, from which you could benefit in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid fast-food and eat healthy. Although this is great advice for any occasion or location, even if you do not travel, the last thing you need when traveling to some unknown location is eating bad food and risking food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While trying to cover some traveling strategies here, there is probably room for even better business travel tips. Some of the above mentioned may not even work for some of your specific needs, but generally all of them should be helpful in some way. Depending on the type of your work and a distance and region of your business trips, you might need to develop your own strategy and re-adjust on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Delivering a presentation, no matter how large or small an audience is, puts you on public display and may be an anxiety-charged task especially if you do not have developed presentation skills. The audience will not just listen to your presentation, they will watch your every move, pay attention to the way you are dressed, the way you talk and the way you behave, especially if you are on the stage. Hence, this may not be such an easy task as it sounds, and no matter how big the audience is, you should know how to create a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn about your audience. It is not the same if you are giving your presentation to a group of high school kids or to business clientele. What may be a very well prepared content for one audience, may bore another, so always know your audience before starting your preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write down the material. Do not just read and hope you will remember everything you might need to say. Write everything down along with the sources of your content. Although you may not need to mention all the sources you used to prepare your presentation, you still want to have those in case of some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice by reading your speech. Read your material over and over until you get bored with it. Once you start being bored, then you are probably ready to make that speech. Try to memorize certain parts whenever possible, but also make sure you have memorized the order of certain topics, as well as of the slide show pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring some small audience. Dress up to look professional, and have that small, hand-picked audience listen to you practice. It can be a group of friends or co-workers with some knowledge of the topic you are presenting. Have them write down some comments about the way you act, as well as about the content itself. Was there something you didn’t explain well enough? Were you too hyperactive with your hands or expressions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a checklist. If you need to bring on some requisites of equipment to your presentation, then it might be a good idea to create a checklist you will follow before going to the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweak your presentation. Now that you got some feedback from the people you trust, do not be afraid to make some final adjustments. Get rid of some boring parts and focus on the parts where you got the best reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relax and get rid of all anxiety. If needed, find a quiet place and relax. Take some time to think about certain parts of the speech, imagine yourself holding a presentation and the audience listening to you. This should boost your confidence before getting down to business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present yourself and the material. Once you get on the stage, present yourself. Then start with the presentation itself. If you feel nervous, try not to think about the people watching and listening to you and try to focus on one person at a time. This way you will have a feeling of talking to just one person, at a time, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, provide the audience with a couple of minutes to ask questions. If you prepared yourself properly, then you will have all the facts ready. Also, be prepared for some not so friendly questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, thank the audience. They listened, you presented, now it’s the time to thank them and leave the stage. Don’t rush off the stage, but do not dangle along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn from your experience after one or more presentations and find your own style. You do not have to hold the presentations like all others, as there are no strict rules. Hopefully some of the elements mentioned here will help you improve your presentation skills and prepare better for the next time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Survey on Mobile Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/mobile-scheduling-survey/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-31T10:32:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/mobile-scheduling-survey</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest trends from various industries based on hourly work show that the use of various automated scheduling solutions is in rise. With many companies competing in that market, the offer of various cloud systems and mobile scheduling apps is huge and increasing. While it is obvious from the flourish of such systems that more and more companies have started using such tools, it appeared at one point that there were no serious research surveys about what employees have to say about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent survey by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwareadvice.com/&quot;&gt;Software Advice&lt;/a&gt;, an HR &amp;amp; employee scheduling review organization, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softwareadvice.com/hr/industryview/employee-preferences-mobile-scheduling-2014/&quot;&gt;Employee Preferences for Mobile Scheduling&lt;/a&gt;) showed very interesting information. The key finding of this research was that more than 55% of the surveyed hourly workers stated that they would be likely to use mobile app scheduling software in case their company started using it. Another very interesting fact was that workers of the service industry were most likely to use this type of software, whereas employees working in the manufacturing industry were the least interested ones, with high percentage of those who would be somewhat unlikely and extremely unlikely to use such a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood to Use Mobile Scheduling App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Likelihood-to-Use-Mobile-Scheduling-App.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Likelihood to Use Mobile Scheduling App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results came as a clear confirmation of what some scheduling companies already mentioned in their news and blog articles. One of the companies offering a smart phone app scheduling solution for employees along with their cloud based backend software is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt;. This prestigious scheduling software company offers a cloud based scheduling solution accessible 24/7 with addition of smart phone apps through which employees can access their schedule at any time they want. With various notifications about incoming shifts or published schedules, this software company appears to be right on spot with the results of the Software Advice’s survey results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namely, one of the top features employees pointed out they would love to see within that mobile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/employee-scheduling-app-an-extra-layer-to-organize-your-schedule-and-data/&quot;&gt;scheduling app&lt;/a&gt; was a time-off request section. Employees would love to have such an option on hand as they would love to be able to request days off in an easy manner, without having to call or schedule a meeting with their manager or employer.  Another very popular feature among employees is a reminder about their shifts which may lead to less late job arrivals or no-shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preferred Employee Scheduling App Features&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Preferred-Employee-Scheduling-App-Features.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Preferred Employee Scheduling App Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule follows exactly these trends and offers such features to its users. Employees using the mobile app can easily request a time-off which automatically comes to their manager for an approval.  Once approved, they get notified via email or SMS. On top of these options, employees can also trade shifts, drop shifts or pick-up open shifts. Whenever a manager or an administrator publishes a new schedule or makes some adjustments to the existing one, employees can choose to get notified about all such changes. By using these features, employees can stay on top of their schedule and be notified properly and on time about all changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since systems like NimbleSchedule utilize various notifications about shifts and shift beginning reminders, then these functionalities can drastically reduce no-show cases and increase employee productivity.  The cost of having employees frequently late or absent from work can go dramatically high without use of such systems, so it appears that systems like this offer a win-win situation for both employees and company owners. Keeping everything well organized creates a good working environment in which employees are happy, managers spend less time on scheduling tasks and have less headaches while company shareholders keep counting income and profits from such a well oiled machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood That Mobile App Could Prevent Shift No-Shows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Likelihood-That-Mobile-App-Could-Prevent-Shift-No-Shows.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Likelihood That Mobile App Could Prevent Shift No-Shows&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these functionalities, NimbleSchedule offers a feature rich reporting system that makes supervision of the whole company or specific departments easy to use and monitor. This process cuts down hours spent on manually creating various reports in order to see employee productivity and cost effectiveness. Employees can configure their availabilities through the system and be scheduled for work only at times that suit them. They can communicate with their co-workers or managers through an internal messaging system and clock-in and clock-out during their work hours for accurate hourly tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule made all these functionalities super easy to use by developing multiple access points through a web panel, mobile website panel or smart phone apps.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Delegating – When, How & to Whom</title>
   <link href="/blog/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-30T09:56:01-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/delegating-when-how-and-to-whom</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people who are perfectionists have a hard time delegating tasks to others. Also, the ones that started their companies as a one-man-show can’t easily let go certain tasks to others once their company starts growing. In order to focus better on more important job tasks, you need to learn to delegate the less important ones or the ones that are not of your interest to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frequently even the managers who delegate tasks and responsibilities to their employees do it the wrong way and end up doing even more than they did at the beginning or they end up with partially done tasks. So in order for everything to run smoothly, you need to know how to properly delegate tasks, when and to whom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/team-work-tasks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/team-work-tasks-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Team work task&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the proper tasks to delegate. Keep the ones of your interest for yourself as well as the ones that are important for your company. Out of the ones you are left with, try to find the ones that you could delegate to certain employees with the right skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait for volunteers. Even though some employees would perhaps volunteer for certain tasks, this does not mean they have the right skill set for such tasks. Always try to pick the right employees with the right skills but at the same time be fair and try not to delegate everything to the same employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to trust your employees. Assuming that you selected your employees with the best skills while hiring, then learn to trust them. Start by delegating tasks of less significance if you have a hard time trusting others and then slowly re-assign those of higher importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on the goal and not on the procedure. If you are delegating tasks to your employee, then let him complete them in his own way. You do not necessarily want to force your methods of work to everyone. The important thing is to get the final result. If you believe your method is the most efficient one, try suggesting it politely, but let your employees explore their own ways and routines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delegate resources and tools for task completion. Also, be prepared to train some employees for certain tasks. Although this may mean that you will spend more time on training them, it will result with less obligations on your plate in the long run. When delegating tasks, remember that your employees will need certain tools and resources to complete them, so always ask yourself they have an access to all resources they might need to complete that job successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the deadline. While bearing in mind that your employees have limitations as well, delegating tasks without specific deadlines may cause a lot of work to stay partially finished with new tasks coming along every day. The best idea is to set a reasonable deadline and ask all your employees to stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share responsibilities, but share credits as well. When delegating certain tasks to employees, make sure to delegate responsibilities for that specific work as well. Besides responsibilities, recognize your employee and give them a credit when they complete some job successfully. Do not hesitate to do that in public or by emailing your staff with a public credit for certain tasks of higher importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for some difficulties. Employees without much experience may frequently get stuck with certain tasks without knowing how to proceed. Be prepared to help them with some advice or information. Do not jump in taking over that task or re-delegating it to others immediately. Try to help your employee resolve some obstacles and let him learn because you might need him in the future for similar work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to say “Thank you, good job!” to your employees when they deserve it. You need to show them you are grateful for the work they do; otherwise, after some time, they might start feeling unappreciated. Although you are the boss, you certainly want to keep your employees happy and your working environment positive.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Handling Calls</title>
   <link href="/blog/handling-calls/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-27T12:53:18-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/handling-calls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The statistics show that the majority of people still prefer a phone call over all the other means of communication. This is why it might be crucial for your business and job to be successful at handling phone calls. In this article we will try to cover some simple call handling procedures that will help you create a positive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer your phone quickly. The client calling might feel you have an unprofessional approach if your phone is ringing for too long and you are not picking up. One of the best call handling procedures would be to try to pick up the phone at the second or third ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/call-handling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/call-handling-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Call Handling Procedures&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduce yourself and greet the caller. Welcoming the caller with some polite greeting may set a positive tone for the whole conversation and stating the company name and your personal name may confirm to the caller that he has reached the right person or at least the right company. Say those opening words clearly and don’t rush through saying them, even though you might repeat them many times through your work day when handling phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen carefully to the caller and try not to multitask. The customer might feel unappreciated if he senses that you are doing other tasks while talking with him. Hence, try to stay focused and listen to the caller. If the caller requires some assistance or help that might take a while to complete, ask him first if he would like to wait or to be called back once that specific task is completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the expectations to the caller. If you need to transfer his call to another person, then make sure to notify the caller about that and, if possible, even announce the person to whom that call is going to be transferred. If you need to put the caller on hold, say that. Don’t just put him on hold without saying anything. People will find that rude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offer to help. Even if the call was intended for some other operator or the manager, offer to help the caller. They might appreciate the offer even if they decide not to take on it. This will show a positive image about you and your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the client’s name. During the conversation do not address the customer as “Dear client” or “Dear customer”, because the caller might think you didn’t want to bother yourself with remembering his name. If the caller introduced himself and stated his name, then use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show empathy to the client for the issues they are experiencing. If the caller complains about some issues or problems he has either related directly to your company and you or to some third party, try to show some empathy. If needed, try to re-insure the caller that you will do your best to have such an  issue resolved and follow by a polite “I’m sorry to hear about those issues” phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not use slang words while handling phone calls. Even if you use such words frequently in your internal communication or private texting with friends, try to cut them off in business communication and keep the professional tone at all times. The customer may not take you seriously if you start using the slang language and may see that as a lack of professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use positive phrasing even if you can’t help the caller. This approach should still set a positive mood for the client and create a nice environment in which the caller will try to see things from the bright end as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close the call formally. If you have agreed to do some task for the caller, then repeat it before closing the call just to confirm to the client that you will definitely address their issues or concerns. At the very end of that call, close it with a formal “Good bye and have a great day” or just “Good bye” if there is a possibility you will speak to each other later on that day again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat every call as an opportunity to improve your standing with a customer and remember that an average person will tell their negative experience to a lot more people than a positive experience. With this in mind, it is of utmost importance to handle your communication with clients at a highly professional level and keep your customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Guidelines for writing e-mail messages</title>
   <link href="/blog/guidelines-for-writing-email-messages/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-25T11:50:01-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/guidelines-for-writing-email-messages</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even though sending an email is a pretty easy and simple task from a technical point of view, we should still pay attention to what and how we send it, especially in business/work correspondence. Generally, we all want our email messages to be taken seriously, but sometimes we don’t pay too much attention to the format and the email etiquette rules. Here are some email writing guidelines that will make your business email look professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/email.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/email-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Email Writing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the subject line short and clear&lt;/em&gt;. Ideally, keeping the subject line up to 5-6 words is the best way to provide a brief and straight to the point topic. Providing long subject lines is a bad approach and is not a way how to write business email. Moreover, such a subject may easily be ignored by the recipient. When correspondence takes a lot of writing back and forth, then try to follow the topic and discussion with a new subject instead of just leaving the original one throughout the whole correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Address the other side by a proper greeting&lt;/em&gt;. It is advisable to start an email with “Dear {title} {last name}”, though this may be slightly adjusted. If the other side signs with their first name, then it is considered that you can address them in your reply by their first name as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the body of an email brief&lt;/em&gt;. People have a tendency just to skim over too long emails, so email messages should be kept to a reasonable length. If there is really a need to write more than a couple of paragraphs, then a conference call or a meeting could be a better idea than sending an email of such a length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limit the number of topics per email message&lt;/em&gt;. Try to keep one email message limited to just one topic. If needed, try to set an expectation for the recipient that there are multiple topics discussed through that particular message. The best way to do that would be through the subject line, for example: “Please see my three questions” or “Please take a look at these issues”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the grammar and spelling of your message&lt;/em&gt;. People tend to make some silly spelling or grammar mistakes because they type in a rush so, whenever possible, try to correct or check for errors before sending. Nowadays, most modern email clients have spell checkers built in, so get used to using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not use emoticons in business correspondence&lt;/em&gt;. Although this is quite an often practice in private email messages, it is not advisable to use emoticons in any kind of work/business related email correspondence. Keep the serious tone of your message if you want to be taken seriously and leave smiley faces for fun messages. Be polite throughout the whole email and always show some professional courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limit the number of recipients to a reasonable number&lt;/em&gt;. If you are sending an email to a large group of people, there is a possibility they won’t read it completely or take it seriously if you included too many recipients. They may also be slightly confused thinking that someone else should respond to that email instead of them and your email could end up without any response. Hence, limit the number to a reasonable amount and, as already mentioned above, try to address those people by a greeting so they are always certain you intended all of them to receive that message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Include a friendly closing&lt;/em&gt;. Let the other side know that you intended to end your message the way you did by adding your signature and possibly some closing like “Best Regards” or “Best wishes”. Otherwise, if you leave out the closing lines, the other party may think that the email was not complete or that you sent it by mistake. It is polite to end it by signing your name, especially if you do not have frequent correspondence with that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these email writing guidelines you will ensure your recipients have received the right information and, as a result, you will get the responses you want.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Outsourcing</title>
   <link href="/blog/outsourcing/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-23T09:51:13-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/outsourcing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What started as a sporadic trend of large corporate giants moving their production to countries with cheaper labor force has become a tendency of even the smallest companies and startups in the last decade or two.  The advancement of technology, and especially the internet, made this process possible for companies of all sizes and resources. The problem is no longer where to find outsourcers because they can be hired from any part of the globe without too much hassle and resources so it has become vital for managers to get acquainted with the how-to-outsource process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-to-outsource&quot;&gt;Why to outsource?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are managing to save a lot of money by outsourcing certain day to day tasks. Law firms started with outsourcing some document review tasks to lawyers from other countries because their pay rates were a lot cheaper than pay rates of domestic lawyers, especially for tasks regarding documentation reviewing. IT companies were able to outsource a lot of their tasks to oversees crew and cut down expenses of pricy IT experts for certain tasks while still keeping some management and leading positions in-house.  A lot of other companies from various niches were able to successfully outsource some general positions like virtual assistants and bookkeepers. Depending on the exact niche your company is in, you may outsource certain positions in an attempt to cut down expenses and even speed up certain tasks if you are already overwhelmed with other duties and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/global-outsourcing.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/global-outsourcing-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Global outsourcing image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-to-outsource&quot;&gt;When to outsource?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no best answer to this question, because some companies first try to develop their business and then outsource certain tasks when there is a need for that, while others do it from the very beginning. What some companies noticed is that certain activities may bring up the costs to an even higher level when outsourced than when being handled in-house. The reason for that is usually inefficient labor force or expensive transporting conditions which then overcome the positive effect of cheap labor force.  So do not rush while making this kind of a decision. Run through all calculations first and see which positions could be outsourced with best expense savings while maintaining efficiency and transport or other costs at a reasonable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-outsource&quot;&gt;What to outsource?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we already mentioned, depending on the exact niche, there are certain positions that can be outsourced pretty much within any company. Theoretically, any positions could be outsourced nowadays; however, that doesn’t mean that it should be done only because it is possible. There are a lot of expert opinions claiming that companies should not outsource their core services or core products. This, for example, means that if a company offers design services, then it should not outsource designers. Again, depending on the company’s focus some highly repetitive tasks should be outsourced whenever possible, such as data entry, shipping inventory, etc. There is also a high demand for outsourcing certain IT services like technical support or part time projects where hiring a trained professional for some short term projects would be very pricy.  Some companies even hire highly skilled experts at significantly lower pay rates to do certain tasks in their companies, such as a financial analysis or similar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-control&quot;&gt;Cost control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same way as companies track any other project costs or production costs, they should monitor the cost of their outsourcing labor and transport. At any time, managers should have clear picture of how much outsourcing is helping them cut down the expenses of production or services along with the costs of shipping of their products in case of manufacturing businesses. Efficiency of such outsourced labor force is also the key factor, so whenever possible the company should use all available tools, such as NimbleSchedule or similar online scheduling solutions to monitor their work force activities, as well as employee efficiency and time attendance.  These factors may mean the difference between success and failure, so keep your outsourcing costs under constant monitoring and learn how to outsource properly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Power of Big Business</title>
   <link href="/blog/the-power-of-big-business/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-20T09:23:14-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/the-power-of-big-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forget about governments and politicians. Big corporations have become an unavoidable political, economical and cultural force in today’s globalized world. We have tackled some similar topics in our previous articles &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/benefits-globalization-business/&quot;&gt;The Benefits of Globalization to Your Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/big-corporations-vs-small-enterprise/&quot;&gt;Big corporations vs. Small enterprise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. But let’s dig in a little bit deeper in the large corporations’ world and point out some of the key facts which might help you especially if you are asking yourself whether working in a big company is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to some relevant resources (&lt;em&gt;UNESCO – Corporate Power Facts and Stats&lt;/em&gt; - from 2000), out of the 100 largest economies in the world, 51 are corporations and 49 countries. With a continuous growth trend of multinational corporations, these statistics are rapidly changing to the benefit of large corporations. Unfortunately, some statistics are not showing such increasing trends and currently the top 200 corporations in the world hire only 0.78% of the world’s workforce, while at the same time consuming over 27% of the world’s economic activity. With such negative statistics, these corporate giants suffer constant critics from various political sides and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big business are frequently centers of innovations. With enormous resources, both financial and human, large corporations are usually innovation leaders in many areas. While indeed these innovations are mostly powered by an economic interest, the benefit of those innovations for all people cannot be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large corporations never come alone and a lot of small businesses benefit from working for or with those giants. The best example for this were transitional periods of some eastern European countries during the 1990s. Wherever large corporations made some investments and stepped in, a big number of medium and small sized companies emerged and benefited from cooperation with them. By increasing the cash flow in certain regions or countries, the opportunity for economic growth naturally rises. This may be a bit harder to notice in the leading economies in the world, yet in some other regions that is easy to determine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in a big company provides a person with better career opportunities. While a risk of losing a job in smaller companies is lower, the opportunity for professional improvement and specialization in certain areas is way higher when working for big players. This is one of the main reasons why a lot of people prefer working for larger corporations. Although not everyone can obviously reach high ranking positions in those large multinational corporations, a sheer possibility fuels large number of employees to work in those environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoin-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open source P2P money&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some futurists predict that in a decade or two, big businesses may start opening their embassies and have their own currencies. While some think this is impossible, some other people see this as a certainty. With a successful expansion of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a P2P currency, who could deny today that in 10 - 15 years some large corporations may not decide to follow that example? In the 1980s, the top 200 companies consumed around 24.2% of the world’s GDP. By the end of the 1990s that number has grown to 28.3% of the world’s GDP. So they certainly do not lack the cash for pushing such a decision through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only large corporations can get from planning to mass production quickly due to substantial resources and aggressive marketing strategies. While indeed the size itself doesn’t guarantee success, having all those resources on hand is a huge potential. Contrary to the popular criticism, the world has also seen a lot of cases where those corporate giants were involved in humanitarian work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just a couple of topics mentioned and discussed here, we will not try to suggest some definitive answer. The conclusion about large multinational corporations and their pros and cons is in your hands. The things in reality are almost never black and white and a serious analysis has to be made and monitored to ensure that the world’s economy is going in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Being diplomatic</title>
   <link href="/blog/being-diplomatic/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-18T10:15:40-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/being-diplomatic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people with a diplomatic approach are considered to be pleasers and pushovers, yet that does not have to be the case. Keeping it calm in certain situations, especially in a working environment, may help avoid pointless escalation and aggravating conflict interaction either with a third party side or between two or more of your own employees or colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are present while some emotionally-charged discussion is being led, you can try to calm things down with a non confrontational and decisive language. In case this doesn’t help, you can always ask the present sides to stop the debate or call for a break until everyone cools off. Once they are a bit calmed down, you can jump in and try to regain the control over the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/diplomatic-way.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/diplomatic-way-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lead your meetings in a diplomatic way&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never show any physical signs of nervousness. So while talking, keep your body and your muscles relaxed. Avoid exaggerated hand talking or pointing finger at anyone. Avoid any nervous eyebrow movements or any facial expressions. Look at the other party and focus on the facts. If the other party shows any signs of insecurity or frustration, ask them to take a step back and to think for a while. You can apply the same rule for yourself. If you find yourself in some situation that may lead you to bursting into anger, try to take a step back and think for a couple of seconds, eventually assuming a diplomatic approach. Take a breath for a couple of times and with a calm voice say what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to allow others to interrupt you. If they do, ask them politely to let you finish what you were saying and once you are done, remind them or let them say what they had in mind. By doing so, you will show the other party some respect while showing some personal integrity.  Remember to keep your voice calm during this process and instead of saying something like “Do not interrupt me”, you can always say something like “Please, let me finish first what I was saying”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not laugh and avoid smiling when you see that the other side is upset about something. Laughing may be a sign of disrespect and may cause them to become even more anxious. Again, with a calm non-confrontational voice state your facts and ask them to take this into consideration. Give them a couple of moments to calm down before providing you with an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always stand up for yourself and do not let anyone think that you are a pushover. Although you may sometimes appear indulging due to your diplomatic approach to emerged problems or issues, do not be afraid to be firm with your point of view and do not back down. Again, try avoiding some confrontational language and instead of saying “No, we will not do these things that way”, you can say something like “I believe that we should do things the way I described”. Try to use some positive words to say that you disagree with the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While being diplomatic in certain situations may seem hard, especially if you are somehow personally affected, keeping things calm may be of a greater benefit and may produce better results in the long run, especially at the working place. Problems and issues come and go, but remember that you have to continue working with the same people tomorrow and the day after. So choosing the diplomatic way of handling things may be the smartest choice you will make.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Negotiating Techniques</title>
   <link href="/blog/negotiating-techniques/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-16T11:22:50-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;_&quot;Never begin a deal, a battle or a love affair if the fear of losing overshadows the prospect of winning.&quot;
Aristotle Onassis, shipping tycoon._&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good negotiation methods and skills are important for the success of any company and there is a popular belief in the business world that negotiation is an actual art.  Although some people appear to be naturally talented negotiators, this does not mean that these skills cannot be trained and improved.  Here are some suggestions that could help you improve your negotiating skills and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set your priorities before starting negotiations. If needed, write everything down and make a list of items ordered by their importance. Draw a line on that list or select the things that are really important for you and choose the ones you are ready to sacrifice in order to make a deal. Once you have that list in front of you, it should be easier to make a decision on whether or not some deal is worth making or it would be better to politely end the negotiation once the things go below your interest limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/negotiation-skills.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/negotiation-skills-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Negotiation Skills and Techniques&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn about the other side before the meeting. Knowing more details about their industry as well as about their management habits and priorities may benefit you through the process of sealing the deal with them. So, if possible, try to discover their priorities. By knowing their goals, it might come easier to offer them an exception that is not that important for you but is important for the other side, which might result in making a deal beneficial for both sides. The best deals are made when both sides leave the table happy and get something they both wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share some information first. No matter how relevant that information is for the actual deal you are negotiating about, sharing some information, either business related or personal related can set the mood for the whole meeting and build some trust. Once you show that you are ready to share some trust, the meeting should go a lot smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the limits and know when to stop. Always be prepared to leave the table if you see that you can’t get more than what you have set as the minimum interest for your side. Sometimes even a sign that you are ready to leave the negotiation may cause the other side to reconsider and make another offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to throw the first offer. According to some research studies, it appears that negotiations quite frequently focus on the first offer that was on the table. While a lot of people believe that they should wait with the offer and try to get some information from the other side first, the statistics show that those companies which made the first offer have come out from deals with a higher success rate. When the main focus of negotiations is the price, the first price thrown to the table is usually the one that both sides take as a starting point, so better make a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not show emotions, keep a calm poker face. Showing too much excitement may cause the other side to think they gave you too much and they might back up in the last moment. So keep your poker face until everything is settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final word, some of these negotiating methods may vary depending on the country and region in the world where you are negotiating. Some cultures are completely different and may require some additional research to be made so you could be prepared the best way possible. While these negotiating skills and techniques may help you get some deal done, you should not restrict to these tips only. Each business and niche may be slightly different so always be ready to adjust yourself along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Being a Good Listener</title>
   <link href="/blog/being-a-good-listener/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-13T08:03:07-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/being-a-good-listener</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How often did you start talking in front of your co-workers or friends and noticed that some of them were not listening at all? How did that make you feel? Do you do the same thing to others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can benefit a lot from being a good listener both in private and professional life. In this article we will try to provide you with some guidelines on how to be an effective listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hold a managing position in your company, you may very often draw a wrong conclusion that you no longer need to listen to your subordinates. This is a common mistake with certain elements of arrogance that a lot of people occasionally make. Listening to your colleagues and your subordinates may bring you a lot of benefits so it’s never late to become a good listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you develop a reputation for being a good listener, you will be able to prevent some of the conflicts in your company that are sometimes inevitable to happen.  Be on top of all internal problems and listen to your subordinates when they complain. This approach may save you from a lot of headaches later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/good-listener.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/good-listener-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Become a good listener&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to your employees when they want to speak up may not only prevent conflict from occurring but it may also create a professional environment for a flow of business ideas that can boost your career and your company’s success. No matter what role some employees maintain in your company, three heads are always smarter than one, and ten heads are smarter than three. So give your employees a chance to contribute and all of you can only benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every idea is a great one. Some points of views or ideas you hear from your employees may not be realistic or, on the other hand, they may be simply too complicated; however, try to pay attention when they present it anyways. By doing so, you will recognize their effort and show them a respect, which they will repay you by doing their job better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While indeed sometimes you may feel a little bit frustrated with every day commitments and obligations or problems, you still need to find some time to listen to people.  Show your employees that you respect their positions and what they have to say, and they will respect you more as a boss and follow you even through the times of hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that multitasking might be your enemy in these situations. Talking over the phone or texting others while listening to your employees or co-workers is not a way of how to be an effective listener and may be considered as a sign of disrespect and lack of interest for their problems and concerns. Hence, you should avoid all distractions such as sending emails, playing with your cell phone or surfing the Internet. Stay focused during the conversation and occasionally repeat by rephrasing something your collocutors said. This will re-assure them that you fully understand what they are saying and help you stay focused as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating your employees in this way may result in increase of respect they have for you. Furthermore, it will show that you do care about their problems and that you are approachable to them, resulting in a boost of productivity and positive working environment. Aside from improving alternative ideas for fixing arising issues and problems, by listening to your employees you also improve decision making, which may differentiate a successful company or department from an unsuccessful one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By being a good listener, you are setting a stage for good cooperation with all your subordinates and coworkers, which will hopefully last for a long time. Establish yourself as a good mentor by being a good listener and enjoy the benefits of your successful cooperation with everyone from your working environment.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Behave in Meetings</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-behave-in-meetings/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-11T09:16:27-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-behave-in-meetings</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping appropriate professional behavior at work is a must because that is a place where you get paid. While very few people have natural confidence and a professional attitude, the “code” of behavior is definitely something that can be learned and trained. In this article, we will try to cover some simple and easy tips and tricks on how to run a successful meeting and leave the best possible impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance does matter&lt;/strong&gt;. First impressions are really important and what people notice first is the way others are dressed as well as their manners. When you have a meeting scheduled, try to keep a professional look but also dress to feel comfortable. If the clothes do not fit your style, then others might laugh behind your back so keep your professional look but also make it fit your usual style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/be-punctual.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/be-punctual-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Never be late for meetings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be punctual, don’t be late&lt;/strong&gt;. You may appear very unprofessional to your associates and bosses, or even employees providing you are a manager if you are constantly late for meetings. Try to arrive a couple of minutes earlier, sit and prepare. Having a small conversation with others before the meeting can’t hurt in setting the mood for the actual meeting. It will give you an opportunity to show others how amazing your personality can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid phone calls, emails and text messages&lt;/strong&gt;. With advancement of technology, a lot of people have become addicted to various gadgets and devices. What frequently irritates people, especially in meetings, is when someone keeps texting during the meeting, which clearly shows that he is not focused on the meeting topic and would rather be somewhere else. Unless you are expecting an urgent call or a text message, then always try to keep your cell phone silent during meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let others speak and listen to them&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are the only one who talks, people might find that rude. Even if you are a boss, let others express their opinion as well. While they are speaking try to stay focused, look at them but don’t stare. Even if that specific topic is not in any way related to your job or even department, people will still appreciate if you listen to them. Do not interrupt others unless completely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t pretend you know everything&lt;/strong&gt;. Overconfidence may be considered by some people as plain bragging. There is no person in the world that knows everything. Even the most successful entrepreneurs in the world had their ups and downs in their career and their share in bad decision making. So don’t be afraid to speak up or to say that you do not agree with someone, but always state your arguments and stay open minded to be convinced otherwise if proper arguments are presented to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not get too excited about some ideas&lt;/strong&gt; - others may consider that as a sign of immaturity. Keep always a calm face with a hint of a smile and never get too emotional. Even if you are excited about some new product or results, try to stay calm. There might always be some aspects you are not aware of at the first glance. Showing anger or frustration may also be taken as a sign of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When talking business always bring up the facts&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t elaborate too long unless being asked, especially if people from other departments are present. Try to explain things in the shortest possible way, yet give your best to present all the facts needed. It will show others that you are on top of your work. Be prepared for some questions, but don’t rush with answers. Make sure you are providing accurate answers to questions. &lt;em&gt;Always be prepared&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Customer Relationship Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/customer-relationship-management/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-09T10:42:42-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/customer-relationship-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We entered a new technological age a while ago and companies that haven’t followed the new age trends are long gone. The companies that have survived had to adjust their strategies, but in the first place, they had to adopt a new customer relationship management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it seems to a lot of managers and company owners that marketing is the most important part of their business strategy, what quite often proves even more important is keeping a good relationship with the current customers and keeping them happy. A good customer relationship management strategy is to keep your current clients coming back for more while gaining new customers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping your clients happy may sound like an easy task, but when your business starts growing and the client base starts multiplying, it may be hard to keep track of everything. That is the right time when you need to have a good customer relationship management strategy. So start preparing one on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of various CRM software systems is an excellent way to track everything. Keep in mind that each customer can be different and each customer has his own needs, so your CRM system must be flexible enough to keep track of these kinds of things. It may sound like a waste of time to enter almost every communication impression or email you exchanged with your clients into your CRM software, but this may come of use in the future and may show to your customers that you took some time and effort to keep track of their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/customer-management.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/customer-management-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Customer Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of meeting records and being well prepared for future meetings may be the key to your success. Any kind of tool that can improve your communication and customer relationship management strategy should be welcome. If you have email accounts of your customers, sometimes just a simple “Happy Birthday” or “Happy New Year” may go a long way so utilize every tool you can in order to keep your relationship with customers on a high professional level, while adding a touch of personality to each such communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, assigning a point of contact to each client may also be an excellent customer relationship management strategy. That way, they would feel there is always someone they can contact in order to get some help or assistance, no matter what niche your business is in. Providing your customers with a personal agent within your company, especially those large or important clients, may be an excellent tactic and may help your stuff prioritize certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When needed, recognize your own mistakes or faults - your clients will appreciate honesty. Unless you work for some government agency, there is really no reason for you to keep a lot of secrets from your clients. Be open and honest whenever possible. Contrary to popular belief, don’t always say “Yes, we can do that for you” unless you are certain you can do it. The customer might lose the trust in you if you promise some things you cannot fulfill.  Hence, be realistic when promising things to your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not complain to your customers about other customers or about your co-workers. Keep your game face on and put a smile on your face even when you have a hard day at work. No matter how good your relationship with your clients already is, they still expect the level of professionalism from you, so keep this always in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Benefits of Globalization to Your Business</title>
   <link href="/blog/benefits-globalization-business/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-06T10:36:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/benefits-globalization-business</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;_&quot;A man&#39;s feet must be planted in his country, but his eyes should survey the world.&quot;_
- George Santayana, philosopher and writer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the whole debate about positive and negative arguments about globalization around the web and in economical circles, we will try to cover some of the benefits for your small to medium sized business. The focus will be on answering this simple question: Are big multinational corporations the only ones that benefit from business globalization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/business-globalization.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/business-globalization-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The world on your palm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globalization improves free trade and boosts the global cash flow. With the development of modern communication tools, especially the Internet, the global trade has become less complicated and more efficient. Nowadays, one can easily communicate with companies and people on the other side of the globe at extremely low costs, if not completely free. With the increase of trade around the world, the costs of transportation are dropping, thus enabling higher profits and competitive prices offered by large businesses who can afford their own transportation cargos. And definitely, with more cash on the market, there is a much bigger opportunity for small and medium sized companies to earn more. In other words, it can be said that the global market development allows bigger equality for small players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides increment of the cash flow on the global level, business globalization also enables higher labor force movements. By lowering labor force costs, companies are getting an opportunity to lower the prices of their products and services. This again enables them to compete with the big market players and gain more customers. Again, with expansion of the Internet it becomes quite an easy task to hire people from completely other side of the world to work with you on some projects, especially in the IT sector, but in other areas as well. By outsourcing some of the work, small and medium sized companies get an equal shot to compete with those large multinational corporations, thus confirming a significant globalization impact on business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of the global market seems to support democratization of other countries and markets, from which everyone benefits. By increasing the market scale and enabling technological development of some not so advanced parts of the world, opportunities grow even more. Nowadays you can find customers in parts of the world that you have never visited or even heard of before. This improves competition between various companies from around the world, enabling those with good products and quality services to survive and make profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of the global world market supports economy independence from politics and outweighs other drawbacks as well. Without those negative influences, you have more freedom to improve your business and focus on your products or services; furthermore, it allows you to be more creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through better communication with different parts of the world, companies become more specialized in certain products and parts, thus enabling other companies or clients to search for higher qualities or cheaper parts for their products or elements of their own service. Not even to mention higher trade or transport potentials in case your company is in any of these business niches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, some of the features we’ve mentioned here may raise other questions and possibly certain negative impacts as well, which brings us back to the most popular topic of listing both pros and cons of business globalization. However, standing and crying about it will not help since many of the world’s best economies claim that the process of business globalization can no longer be stopped, so you’d better learn to live with it, and try to benefit from it. Improve your company operations through one or more of these features.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>6 Simple Ways to Boost Employee Morale Without Pizza</title>
   <link href="/blog/boost-employee-morale/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-06T00:43:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/boost-employee-morale</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![how to boost employee morale](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boost-employee-morale.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boost-employee-morale.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Boosting Employee Moral takes more than hot air. But not much more. 
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No foozball. No whack employee lounges or gourmet coffee bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.melcrum.com/research/change-crisis-communication/three-stage-strategy-improving-employee-morale&quot;&gt;Engagement and morale go hand in hand&lt;/a&gt; and both of them can and should be handled together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for lots of us, cracking the morale and engagement nut is the most difficult and time consuming management challenge on the table. Boosting employee morale, and keeping it up there, takes some very specific changes. Not just to company culture, but to definitions and thinking and all those difficult things that make lots of managers want to throw up their hands and throw in the towel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is literally strewn with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.custominsight.com/employee-engagement-survey/&quot;&gt;employee engagement surveys and advice and measurement protocols&lt;/a&gt; but in the end…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-engagement-is-not-that-difficult&quot;&gt;Employee Engagement is NOT that difficult.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A boost to employee morale is easy, too.&lt;/strong&gt; And the two things go together or they don’t go at all. Making employees “feel better” about a job they don’t care about and a company that’s sinking is not in anyone’s interest. **
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the six most important things you can do to Boost Employee Morale without pizza and without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Ask and then listen&lt;/strong&gt;
Not in a meeting and not in a formal way, but regularly. When you’ve listened and understood, then you can start to work on meeting the needs and desires of your employees. One manager can do this with each of her charges. Or it can be bigger and can even be done company wide…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2) Institutionalize asking and listening
**That’s not to say “make it formal” but on the contrary, make it regular, a normal part of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably need some internet— maybe some intranet—support, but that’s part of the game. Set up a continual feedback loop that let’s people on top better understand the thinking, perspectives, experience and wisdom from charges beneath them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Dump the Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dump the meetings, too.&lt;/strong&gt; Employees want to be heard, but not in a formal, jeopardy-ridden setting. Use your continual feedback tools and mechanisms to give employees a good share in the voice of the operation. Surveys are often designed for measuring, and not for learning. So survey away, but you are only going to get more measurements of what’s wrong, and very little idea of how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Keep the Anonymity&lt;/strong&gt;
The good thing about surveys is that employees suspect that they can’t really be tracked back to them. If that’s not the case then your surveys are probably useless anyway. &lt;strong&gt;Keep the Transparency, along with the anonymity.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s important. Employees shouldn’t face risk for pitching in to help - even if what they say is painful and seemingly destructive. Put your big boy pants on and listen without seeking retribution even if there is an oddball or two in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 5) Big, Important, Open-Ended Questions
**This is really where most employee morale and engagement programs fail. Pizza is a lousy incentive for being more involved. The important questions—even when they involved management structures and why things don’t get done—those are the questions that employees want to answer. Again,  maybe not every employee, but the good ones are ready. They should have an open, safe and protected place to put things out there and for you to receive them. Very often, companies suffer, and sometimes suffer a lot, to protect the turf of people who shouldn’t have turf or who have turf that they aren’t covering well. The list goes on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Thank Employees Excessively&lt;/strong&gt;
The action taken based on what you learned is not quite thanks enough. If information was not given anonymously, and you know who to thank, then do so personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To boost employee morale, you don’t need to do ANY FEEL-GOOD - BE HAPPY exercises. NONE.  Those are depressing and they make everyone feel worse. Plastering a pizza party over the problems that are really affecting one of the most important things in people’s lives is not a morale booster but a spirit crusher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember too. The best ways to thank people are with scheduled free time, time off and days off and vacation or flextime. Make them love you, and the love will be there when the company needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Getting a Job in the Financial Sector</title>
   <link href="/blog/finance-jobs/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-04T07:35:23-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/finance-jobs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The financial industry is a major employer in all developed economies today. Being multifaceted, it offers a wide range of jobs from traditional professions, like accountancy, banking and insurance, to entry level finance jobs in the financial sectors of companies or the public sector. After obtaining a degree, the business graduate can choose to specialize in areas like risk management, financial controlling, or treasury, or in more glamorous professions such as equity and bond trading on stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/finance-job.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/finance-job-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Select your preferred finance degree career&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The employment quest should start by analyzing career options, selecting the industry sectors that are in need for new professionals and focusing on the entry level finance jobs that align with one’s long-term interests and competencies. As there are countless finance degree careers, it may take years for one to find the best fit, but eventually this time-consuming search will pay off. Being a highly skilled industry with many opportunities for gaining professional qualifications, finding the most suitable niche in the finance industry is worth all the efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most employers are now looking for the skills that are much wider than traditional ideas of numeracy. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;good relationship skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;leadership skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;numeracy, accuracy and excellent computer skills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;commitment and motivation, as top jobs require long hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;team playing, as lot of work is nowadays done in project teams so the ability to work in teams is of crucial importance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;networking which can be essential in jobs like accountancy or investment banking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When applying for entry level finance jobs, applicants should send their resumes together with their cover letters, summarizing their main qualifications, achievements, and skills. The cover letter needs to be adapted to the demand of each particular job advertisement as it is intended to show the employer how the applicant fulfills the requirements of the company’s recruitment profile. Note that some employers may want to select only the applicants that already have relevant work experience so gaining some experience even by working for free during internship will be beneficial - that will at least ensure that one receives a letter of recommendation for the work done from the supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once hired, some workers might be expected to complete certain periods of training. In other words, they may need to gain qualifications through evening classes or day-release programs, which will demand their full commitment and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed in the finance industry and beat out the competition, one must have desire, intelligence and discipline. It may not be so difficult to break into this industry yet it will be tough to build a reputation of a serious and successful player. If one is highly motivated, soon he will see himself moving up the corporate ladder and enjoying the fruits of his labor.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dealing with Complaints</title>
   <link href="/blog/dealing-with-complaints/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-02T06:43:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/dealing-with-complaints</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When working with people, you might receive complaints from time to time despite your best efforts to meet clients’ expectations. Dealing with upset or even angry customers should be taken as a challenge, the constructive one, which will help you improve your products or services. You should keep in mind that the unsatisfied customer always has two choices: 1. to complain to you or 2. to leave and switch to your competitors without saying a word. The way you deal with this situation will determine whether or not your deserve this customer’s loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First and foremost, you should be calm and relaxed when dealing with a complaint at the same time providing assurance to the customer that the issue will be resolved. You should speak in a friendly, helpful manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is vital that you do not lose your temper and that you do not argue. Under no condition, do not let to be involved in an argument. If you see that you are losing control over the situation, the best idea would be to involve someone else, which usually makes the situation less tense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/complaints-handling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/complaints-handling-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nourish the tree of your customers&#39; loyalty&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let the customer explain their problem and do not interrupt them until they have finished. If they are frustrated, let them talk until they have released their anger. At the same time, listen carefully and try to get as many facts and details as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, ask them in a caring manner. Be sympathetic and use attentive listening techniques. Showing to the customer that you understand the problem and that you are willing to resolve it will defuse a potentially escalating situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apologize for the inconvenience and do not waste time either on defending your company or blaming someone else. Never make excuses. Instead, offer to investigate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask the person what they think the answer is. Becoming a partner with a complaining customer in resolving an issue is a great approach when dealing with complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explain what you are going to do about the problem. Make sure that you do it and once you have resolved the problem, let the customer know about that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have in mind that gaining a new customer is much more expensive than keeping an existing one. Hence, addressing and solving the issue the complaining customer has brought to your attention should be your top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time Management Techniques</title>
   <link href="/blog/time-management-techniques/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-29T09:38:24-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/time-management-techniques</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good organizational skills do not always come with genes so you can work on them if you are keen on improving yourself. Here are a few simple tips and pointers that may help you get started with your time management planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plan ahead&lt;/em&gt;. Write down all your duties and tasks, including work related and family/private obligations on a daily and weekly basis. Try to have everything written down for the week ahead and leave small adjustments for each day. You can’t predict everything, so you can always expect some small urgent tasks to arise during the week. Make sure your list is properly prioritized and try to get more urgent and important tasks done as soon as possible, leaving less important tasks for later on. That way, if you run out of time or you are simply too tired, you can always shift parts of the tasks to the following day. When possible, try creating even longer term plans, for a month or even a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Break down big projects/tasks into smaller chunks&lt;/em&gt;. Huge projects may intimidate you and cause you to waste time on panicking; they can cause you to lose your motivation easily because there is simply too much work ahead. It may even look to you that you haven’t achieved anything for the whole day or for days if you are working on one big project. By breaking it down to small sub-tasks, you can clearly see your day to day progress, which will keep you on track and make you more motivated. On top of that, you can even delegate parts of your project to others, either to your employees or teammates, and get the job done through the team work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/time-management.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/time-management-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Effective Time Management Strategies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get organized and schedule your time accordingly&lt;/em&gt;. Use all available tools to get yourself organized. If you have a smart phone, then there are a lot of apps that can help you in this process. Once you are well organized, try to estimate how much time certain duties will take, time-wise, and create a schedule. When possible, try to mark certain tasks with distinct colors, which will help you prioritize your to-do list. This is definitely the part where tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt; can come very handy as they can help you organize both yourself and your team in a more efficient way at the same time ensuring smooth time management planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus and avoid distractions&lt;/em&gt;. You will be surprised how much more work you can get done without having a phone or TV distracting you every couple of minutes. Try avoiding working with people who do not take their work seriously and impose a serious distraction. Focus on getting one part of the work done in 60-90 minutes and then reward yourself with a small break. It doesn’t have to be an actual work break - having a couple of minutes thinking about something else or just taking a walk to the bathroom and back may help regain your concentration. Do not let such breaks consume too much time, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delegate and avoid multi-tasking&lt;/em&gt;. When there is an additional set of hands available, try delegating parts of your tasks to others, either to co-workers or employees providing you are a manager or employer. At the same time, avoid performing a couple of tasks at the same time when possible. You will have a much better focus when doing one thing at a time. Delegating, being one of the most effective time management strategies, will also improve the quality of your work and it will ensure equal distribution of work throughout the organization. Hence, multi-task only when it is completely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is not just about work&lt;/em&gt;. Always dedicate certain time to your family members and friends. Having a rich and successful private life will help you grow your career and will definitely help you re-energize after a hard working day. Organize your day the best way you can so you have enough time to get a good sleep which is vital for your focus and health. Stay healthy, or else everything else falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you manage to better organize your life and your tasks, you will feel less stressed and more productive. There are neither universal recipes nor effective time management strategies that will work for everyone the same way. You have to find the right balance, knowing your own potentials and characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Problem Solving Techniques</title>
   <link href="/blog/problem-solving-techniques/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-28T00:12:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/problem-solving-techniques</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When working in a team, no matter how small or large that team is, you can expect occasional problems with certain projects, employees or co-workers. The important rule in such situations is to stay calm, analyze the problem and find the best solution that can be implemented efficiently and at the least possible cost. Even if you are a freelancer managing your own time and work duties, you may come across similar issues. Here, we will present some of the business problem solving techniques along with a couple of tips and tricks that might help you develop better problem solving management skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/problem-solving.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/problem-solving-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Problem solving at work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarify the problem – define it&lt;/em&gt;. Always make sure you understand the exact problem, where it is happening, how, and who is directly and indirectly affected by that problem. Without clearly understanding these factors, you might take a completely wrong approach, causing you to lose both time and money. Understanding the problem should be your top priority when involved in business problem solving situations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gather the facts to better understand the problem&lt;/em&gt;. Do not hesitate to reach out to customers or co-workers or other employees in order to gather more facts and info about the problem you are facing. Put down a list so that you can better organize yourself. Do not rush with conclusions. If it takes a while to gather all the facts, then take your time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think about possible solutions&lt;/em&gt;. Find all available alternatives for solving that problem and examine every possible approach. When determining the best solution, make sure to take all inputs into consideration. How much will that solution cost? How much time will it take? Is it realistic and will it give good results? How will that solution affect your employees or co-workers? What’s the risk?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consult with others about your chosen approach&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes others will spot the things you might not have taken into consideration, which could turn out to be important. Get their opinions and verify that the chosen solution is indeed the best one for you and your company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop an execution plan&lt;/em&gt;. Are there any shortcuts? Can you handle everything on your own or you want to delegate the execution of your plan? Form the strategy that will cost least with a maximum impact. If you decide to delegate the execution to your co-workers or employees, make sure to properly supervise that process. Leaving some issues and tasks half finished and half unresolved is a bad practice in business problem solving situations. If you are handling the execution of your plan on your own, and you estimate it will take a while, then break it down in steps. Breaking down a large procedure in smaller chunks will help you focus on the goal itself and execute your plan in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Explain your decision and plan to your coworkers and employees&lt;/em&gt;. Make sure everyone is on board with your decision and, if needed, explain the implementation of your solution and state the expected goals and results. Again, follow up with the person in charge of your plan execution and monitor the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was the problem properly solved? Check on results and analyze&lt;/em&gt;. Examine the procedures taken as well as the overall costs in order to determine whether or not the right solution was applied for that specific problem. If a similar problem occurs in the future, will you involve the same people in your plan execution? Have you learned anything from this problem and are there any options to prevent it from happening again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as many times said, there are no universal solutions and answers that can be applied in just any given situation. Some problems may require you to adjust the steps, spend more time or resources on resolving those issues, or even hire professionals with problem solving management skills to help you determine specific problems, especially in large companies.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Overcoming Employee Resistance to Change: 5 Key Points to Address</title>
   <link href="/blog/resistance-to-change/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-27T01:19:58-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/resistance-to-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![overcoming employee resistance to change](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/resistance-to-change.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/resistance-to-change.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Employing &quot;creatures of habit&quot; can be profitable or it can be an expensive disaster.  
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make a lot of recommendations for organizational change, continuous improvement and basically for making things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know, too, that few people are as bushy tailed and bright eyed as our eager human resources and management readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pity then that so often we run smack into brick walls. Some of those brick walls can take the form of C-suite resistance, for which there is one set of solutions. Other solutions are necessary for meeting resistance from steady, even dedicated and otherwise good employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In most cases, employee resistance to change comes down to simple misunderstanding. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can carefully and clearly explain the “why?” behind every change, then you will, almost certainly, see better results. But that’s just the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, for many of the people in your organization, committing to your organization has meant committing a good part of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re usually talking about “positive change” here—more freedom, more transparency and more employee education (to name just a few examples). But any change can seem difficult to adjust to, so even the things that seem obvious to you might not appear equally positive to your charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Demonstrate Need&lt;/strong&gt; – There is a big picture and often enough, your employees can not see it. Celebrating the last day of one employee after another undoubtedly affects employees and you better believe that they know that something is up. &lt;strong&gt;But what is it?&lt;/strong&gt; Changes to the ways you hire, train, schedule and celebrate employees are all something of a mystery if you work in a company that doesn’t communicate well or much of anything at all. But don’t leave employees in the dark about any of these changes. Any employee resignation is a cause for alarm, and employees need to know that you heard the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Demonstrate Vision –&lt;/strong&gt; This is a big word for anyone interested in organizational leadership. In concise terms, it can mean just explaining a lot of the “Why?” and exactly how and what your changes are intended to address. If you’re introducing more flexible scheduling, then not everyone will qualify at first. Work with everyone so that they clearly understand what they changes require of them, and what they can do to become recipients of all of the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Demonstrate the Benefits&lt;/strong&gt; – This one also slips through the cracks. To you, it’s obvious. And employing “creatures of habit” can be profitable or it can be an expensive disaster. In both cases, employees know what they want, and they don’t want to be the last person left in a company that lost everything because it couldn’t adapt to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Demonstrate Support&lt;/strong&gt; – Software doesn’t just mean everything is easier now. Roll-outs and implementations can take months and the frustrations can skyrocket. But that’s just the software. Lots of employees never get near the technical angels of the roll out and simply get instructions, sometimes by email. Make the right personnel known and available. Addressing doubts, fears, concerns or simple questions - in person and on demand is part of how tech companies do it. HR departments learn to do it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Address Routine&lt;/strong&gt; – As much as we complain about it, the routine of work allows for a lot of things to get done. Workers can feel confident that few surprises are on the horizon, and in many cases, you’ll actually see better results &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; people can rely on the routine of the work day. Routines help them to manage time as much as calendars, smart-phones and meeting schedules. Work with team leaders to manage interruptions to the routine, whenever you’re presenting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carefully managing change, however you do it, is the real key to success. Employees will put up real resistance to change that is improperly or carelessly presented. And though you probably can’t revolutionize the way your organization communicates, in some sense, a robust communications plan needs to be part of your implementation strategy. Let us know how you’re changes are being met in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Unwind at the End of the Day</title>
   <link href="/blog/unwind-end-day/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-25T12:57:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/unwind-end-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a hard day at work there is no better reward for anyone than some relaxation time. Getting rid of stress may be a bit harder than it sounds, so you have to create a stress-free atmosphere for yourself. There are many ways you can do that, but here we will try to propose a couple of ways of relaxing after work that really work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read a good book. This may be one of the most relaxing ways to unwind after a long day at work. By reading a book you will get your thoughts off your work and other stressful things and focus on the book itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long and hot bath. Fill in your bathtub with warm water, light up some candles and dive in. Let all your worries go away. This is one of the most popular and best ways to get rid of stress. Let the hot water and a nice candle scent take you somewhere far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch TV or listen to music. This is definitely another popular way of relaxing after work. Kick back, open a can of soda or beer and watch TV or listen to some relaxing music. The choice of program is relevant so you may want to avoid heavy emotional topics or politics, and watch some comedy or even cartoon shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a massage. This is a perfect way to get all your muscles relaxed and properly treated. Schedule a massage in one of those nice places for 30-60 minutes and enjoy while it lasts. Your muscles and the whole body carry that stress, so what could be a better way to relax? Take massages as often as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/unwind-with-the-wine.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/unwind-with-the-wine-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Relaxing after work with a glass of wine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice dinner and good wine. Make the most of your free time and go out with your partner or friends. Enjoy some nice dinner time with people you care about with a glass of good wine. Why not making this a weekly or monthly ritual?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a good sleep. If you’ve been working hard for days and you have had no chance to have a good night’s sleep, use your spare time for a nice nap. Bring everything you might need close to bed and dig in for a refreshing sleep as long as you can. There is no better way to re-energize than a good sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chill out with friends. Watching a match, telling jokes or just enjoying some relaxed chit-chat with your friends are considered to be the most relaxing after work activities. Play some music, have a couple of drinks or order fast food. The positive spirit of your friends will get you energized for the working days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a walk through a park. Meet your friends or partner after work and take a nice relaxed walk through a local park. This method will help you relax especially if you work in front of a computer or in a stuffy office. Take a long walk, and enjoy the fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch off your mobile phone. Get your peace of mind for a couple of hours and do things that relax you. Cook your favorite meal or just enjoy the silence of your home. Breathe deeply and relax. Lie on the floor and put your feet up. Let your blood flow through your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend some quality time with your family. Dedicate some time to your child or to your partner. Enjoy their company. If you have a pet, then play with the pet as well, it will help you relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave your work at the office. Do not bring your office worries to home - it’s your sanctuary. Never carry out your job stress when leaving the office. Try to restrict all work related calls to business hours only, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Big corporations vs. Small enterprise</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference in how small and large businesses handle various things - from the organizational structure to customer handling and the employees’ working environment. What appears to be quite normal to large companies may sometimes look very strange to small businesses. In addition, different characters and career goals call for different selections. Therefore, this article will be focused on small business vs. large corporations and their advantages and disadvantages, in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the working environment. Large corporations usually have more resources and money to invest into working conditions. However, as noticed in some recent studies, small business owners have started to invest much more money into making everyday working conditions way better than they used to be in order to keep their good workers in their companies. Consequently, this may lead to the fact that small companies start offering better working conditions than giant corporations. Yet, if building a business career is your goal, then those big players are an obvious choice for you even though getting a job in one of those large corporations may require some extra effort and multiple interviews and checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/big-vs-small.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/big-vs-small-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Small Business vs Large Corporations - Pros and Cons&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a low number of employees, you might start feeling as a family member in a small company. While this may be a pleasant feeling for some people, it may become a nightmare if you don’t get along with other team members and there is no other department or office to go. Obviously there are two sides of that medal. If you are an easy going person and you get along well with your co-workers, then working for a small firm will be a pleasure for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting some job done in a big corporation may involve a lot of bureaucracy and a whole process to get something verified or approved. The system is there because large corporations need to be careful about every move they make. As a result, this may often cause a headache, especially in situations when you need to get some procedure slightly adjusted. Are you a patient person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in a small enterprise environment may require you to take on broader duties which are beyond your comfort zone. Unlike with those big corporations where you need to possess an expertise level in one or two specific areas, with small businesses that knowledge should sometimes be more extensive and may involve some learning process as well. On the other hand, you will have to get specialized in certain areas to work for those big players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although large corporations may offer career advancement opportunities, statistics say that small businesses offer better job security. As already mentioned, since employees start being treated like family members after a while, small business owners hesitate to fire them. The firing process becomes much more stressful for them because it is not easy to fire a family member, right? As an opposite side of the story, you might get fired in large corporations even if you performed well at your job. If the directive comes from the top that some employees have to be fired, your days in that company might become numbered. It appears easier to fire employees if you do not know them personally, as is often the case with big corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conclusion, we can only tell you to pick carefully according to your skills and temper. Do not force yourself to be something you are not. Choose the best fit for your working environment and, hopefully, everyday duties at your work station will be a pleasant ride.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Ways to Push Workplace Transparency</title>
   <link href="/blog/workplace-transparency/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-22T00:50:54-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![transparency business](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/workplace-transparency.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/workplace-transparency.jpg)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Letting the sun shine in is imperative, but it&#39;s easier than you might think, too. ****
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplace Transparency rules the day. Much bigger, and public, companies have had not only their books open, but a clear sense of direction, mutual purpose and understanding. Today, even far smaller and family-owned firms are being forced to face the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best people—the ones who make your money—demand that things be crystal clear, and that can mean everything on up to and including once private board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re company is still playing Cloak and Dagger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-transparent-is-your-workplace-2014-8&quot;&gt;you’re not alone&lt;/a&gt;. But believe it or not, you’re probably already losing some of your best people because of it. Competition is fierce enough that your star players are considering other offers, possibly better offers, from companies where the field is more level and where everything but everything is out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long gone are the days of &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoplehro.com/what-do-employees-want/&quot;&gt;good benefits and vacation time&lt;/a&gt;. The really good people want education, flexibility, and meaning. Mission, values and commitment don’t come far down the same list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-not-just-a-paycheck-anymore&quot;&gt;It’s not just a paycheck anymore:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While employee engagement levels scrape all time lows, certain companies are catching on and pushing forward with the most engaging workplace factor of all: MEANING.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to push for not only transparency, but meaning too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Transparency&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is forever.&lt;/strong&gt;
Your company’s meaning, and the meaning derived from working there may very well change over time. But unlike fooz-ball tables in the break room and encounter groups for your team-building, transparency, honesty and openness are going to be with us. At least until the entire internet is handed over to a world government for monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2) Trust - not Bust. **
Compliance teams today are just as popular as ever. (They’re not popular.) But they need, today, to justify any action they take. And management needs to be working towards getting the full 99% of working people inside of those few rules and to set them free. Compliance is a skeleton crew with a very limited and obvious role. Management very often works parallel to compliance, but they reap the rewards only by trusting their people to understand and respect the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Engage **
We understand this now. Most of us. Bring leadership into the loop. Is leadership tuned in to what it means to have employees caring and caring to understanding. **How do you do that?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s as simple as dollars and cents. Return. You’ve got to be able to argue hard numbers with the big guys. There’s not much more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Put People First&lt;/strong&gt;
Obviously, we write a lot here about offering flexible scheduling and finding work-life balance. But that’s only part of it. HR is how you manage your money making, not how you control adversarial interests. Revise your policies and explain why. Justify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5) Retain
**If you’re really losing people, still, then you should be looking carefully at what needs to be done to keep your best people in place. What are the rates for the most important positions? And which departments are losing the most? Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**6) Fully and Deeply Explore
**For the real “Cloak and Dagger” old-school, usually family-owned companies, you’ve got to look carefully at the most “unspeakable” topics in your organization. They’re not going to go away. And in some cases, they can swell, and mutate and come back to bite you. The solution is probably to cut down until you’re only working with insiders who know the family secrets. Everyone else is expendable. So if you want to grow, you’re going to either get rid of the awful secrets, or shrink to the size where everyone is in on the deep and the dark and the embarrassing.   **
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**7) Revise Policies and Communicate the Revisions.
**No matter what the C-suite wants to believe, suspicion costs you. It costs in terms of dis-engagement, only holding onto only the listless and the determined to do as little as possible. It also costs an organization in employee turn-over and simple mis-trust. HR, and mangement, need to continually revise policies and keep a running list of what policies need revision. The policy, then, is to communicate often and well, what exactly are the policies, how have they changed, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we left something out, or you’ve got a practical idea for moving from “cloak and dagger” into the profitable sunshine, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How To Advertise Open Positions</title>
   <link href="/blog/advertise-open-positions/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-20T09:25:51-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/advertise-open-positions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posting an ad for an open position in your company sounds as a piece of cake, yet if poorly formulated, it may cause you to waste hours and hours of your time talking with the candidates not well suited for your exact needs. If we add thousands of websites and posting boards for job advertisements to that formula, some of which cost even a couple of hundred of dollars, then obviously this process should not be taken so lightly. Knowing that you can waste considerable amount of money for job applicants not exactly qualified for your post, you should be very careful when advertising job position. Here are some basic guidelines which will make your job opening look irresistible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: &lt;em&gt;Carry out an in-depth analysis of the job opening and gather all the requirements an applicant should meet.&lt;/em&gt; Although it may take you some time to analyze thoroughly all the duties and tasks you wish your new employee to perform, having a list of the right skills in your job ad post will be beneficial when you advertise job openings in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hire-the-right-employee.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hire-the-right-employee-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hire the right employee&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: &lt;em&gt;Choose the right medium for your job post.&lt;/em&gt; There is an increasing number of online users every day on the global level and companies more often than ever use online resources and boards to advertise job openings. However, for some types of businesses, especially for small businesses on a local level, advertising job position in local newspapers may produce better results than on the Internet. On the other hand, with so many directories and websites targeting specific niches, online ad postings may reach a wider audience. Ranging from free to post websites to those that charge up to a couple of hundreds of dollars for such a post on their website, there are plenty of resources to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: &lt;em&gt;Create an appealing job description while clearly pointing out the applicant’s requirements.&lt;/em&gt; If you are advertising job position online, then you will probably have more space to write something about your company. A couple of positive and energetic sentences describing your organization and working environment may attract more qualified workers to apply for that open position. At the same time, be very clear and specific about both the applicant’s qualifications and job requirements so that you would not waste time with the ill-suited candidates. Do not hesitate to underline or bold those parts of the text with the most important competences. If the ad is too general and non-specific, then you are in risk of wasting your time and effort by having inadequate candidates applying for the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4: &lt;em&gt;Always include the company/post location in your ad.&lt;/em&gt; By doing this you will exclude those potential candidates who do not live near the company and as such are not willing to travel significant distances on a daily basis. Furthermore, you will save considerable time which you can use to focus on other, more appropriate candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5: &lt;em&gt;Be careful when selecting paying ad services.&lt;/em&gt; Some websites offer unrestricted access to their workforce database where you can browse for specific candidates on your own. If you decide to use such a service, then make sure you have previously read the reviews about their targeting niche and the number of the active users in their databases. On the other hand, if you select plain board post websites, then try researching their targeting audience or the number of visitors, which may give you a better picture whether or not they are worth spending the money. Reading some reviews about those websites and services may save you a couple of hundred of dollars so make sure you do that prior to advertising job position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start receiving resumes or notifications about new applicants, have a new hire’s direct supervisor help you with the initial screening process. As someone who will be working with the new hire on a daily basis, you probably want to hear their input as well and keep your current team members happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not hesitate to repeat the whole procedure if the right candidate was just not there in the first attempt. Waiting for a while for the right person may just pay off in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Technology - You Either Love It or Hate It</title>
   <link href="/blog/small-business-and-technology/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-18T08:23:37-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/small-business-and-technology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The modern world keeps offering new apps and gadgets that people can use in various ways. What started as a simple way to improve communication between people, especially between those separated by large distances, nowadays takes over our lives and even causes some concerns. Can technology be used in a healthy, productive way? Can technology help you grow your business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is very simple: &lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor your business productivity using technology.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of apps and online tools that will help you monitor your employees’ performance and business productivity. Set your goals easily and monitor the performance of either one employee or whole departments using tools available. This is where apps like Nimble Schedule come very handy and may help you increase the overall employees’ performance as well as track business goals and employee attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/data-cloud.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/data-cloud-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Move your data to the cloud&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your data to the cloud&lt;/strong&gt;, and access them easily from anywhere in the world with any tool available. Most of those cloud apps will allow you access using both a web browser and smart phone apps. This is a perfect way of handling your business on the go and an opportunity to supervise your employees’ performance or join the internal company messaging system and be involved in daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let those inexpensive online tools help you turn your business into a money making machine.&lt;/strong&gt; Pull out reports with a single click of a mouse button and focus more on setting new goals and applying new routines and products. Analyze costs and incomes of your company on a weekly or daily basis and stay ahead of all possible issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect your employees virtually and let their business communication flow.&lt;/strong&gt; Daily communication and consulting about various issues or opportunities may prove very useful and beneficial. Do not hesitate to connect your employees and departments and provide them with an easy to use channel of communication. This will improve issue handling and may provide improvements in the areas where employee collaboration is a must. Additionally, this will also help employers and managers to stay on top of everything and keep an archive of some internal agreements and communication messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve customer and employee scheduling using cloud apps.&lt;/strong&gt;  The time has come to ditch all those paper notes and spreadsheets and start using 24/7 accessible cloud info. Let your employees view their schedule anytime they wish, ask their co-workers to replace them or request a time off easily by using their smart phone. Schedule your meetings through the cloud and let your team members view your schedule and help you gather material or provide you with other information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use marketing plug-ins and tools to compete with large industry players.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of Gmail plug-ins and various marketing tools coming at very affordable prices that will help you compete with those big companies from your niche. Stay on top of your business contacts, follow leads, deals and sales and much more using free or very affordable online resources. Build your client loyalty by offering various reward tracking programs made easy for small and medium business through the use of specific online tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of how you can use technology for your company’s benefits and easier monitoring of your costs and sales as well as employees’ performance. We haven’t listed the specific names of the tools since every company might need a slightly different feature set so we leave that to you to explore. As nowadays small business and technology go hand in hand, don’t hesitate to use online and cloud resources whenever possible to take your company to the road of success.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Exporting Timesheets to QuickBooks Now Available</title>
   <link href="/blog/exporting-timesheets-to-quickbooks-now-available/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-17T05:40:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/exporting-timesheets-to-quickbooks-now-available</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are very pleased to announce the release of the latest NimbleSchedule update, which now includes QuickBooks online integration. With this addition, all customers using QuickBooks Online for their accounting needs will have an easy way to export their employee timesheets with one click directly to QuickBooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all other updates, this is a &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; addition to NimbleSchedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, select QuickBooks from the “Applications” section of NimbleSchedule and after going through the authentication process, you will notice a new “export to QuickBooks” option on the timesheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MyAccountApplications.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/MyAccountApplications-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to integrate Quickbooks with NimbleSchedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/QBConnectWidget.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/QBConnectWidget-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quickbooks Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ExportToQuickbooks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ExportToQuickbooks-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Export timesheet entries to Quickbooks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system will automatically flag all the entries you have already exported and it will warn you if you try to export duplicate entries. Note that in order for the export to work, your employees in NimbleSchedule must match what you have in QuickBooks. At the moment, only timesheet entries are being exported but we plan to expand this integration to allow you to import employees from QuickBooks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay Nimble!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Make Your Employees Happy</title>
   <link href="/blog/keep-employees-happy/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-15T10:10:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/keep-employees-happy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every good manager is aware of the importance of happy and satisfied workforce. He knows that keeping his employees motivated will have a considerable impact on productivity. The art of motivating workers is a delicate one yet we’ll try to single out a few tips that will indisputably motivate your employees and boost their happiness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believe it or not, but when asked, most employees state it is not money but confidence and trust that really matter. We don’t claim that a decent bonus would not be a motivator to some people but in the long run, appreciating and valuing one’s effort and work is much more gratifying. The more your employee feels confident and valuable to your company, the more engaged he will be while performing his tasks, which will eventually reflect in the overall productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/make-your-employees-happy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/make-your-employees-happy-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The road to happiness&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing that will keep employees happy is giving them a voice. Knowing that they can express their thoughts and share their ideas can lead to creating a more creative and productive work environment. Therefore, encourage communication, and above all, be a good listener. On the other hand, be open with your workers and let them know what is expected of them. Upon completion of the task, do not forget to provide them with constructive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that many people spend one third of their average day at work, they would like to spend those working hours in a pleasant business atmosphere, surrounded by helpful and polite co-workers. Something that will motivate your employees is organizing team building activities through which they will increase the sense of belonging to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you manage to instil the sense of ownership among your crew, its members will be more motivated to take care of the company’s well-being whereas the morale within the team will be high. That way they will become more confident and enthusiastic and they will contribute more to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your employees grow with your company - this will pay off a hundred fold sooner or later. What will motivate your employees is definitely an opportunity for developing, learning and improving. Hence, rotate their responsibilities and encourage them to leave their comfort zone and learn new skills. Bring out their best and watch them evolve and change along with the company itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Displaying an interest and empathy is one of the key ingredients that will keep employees happy. Get to know them and their wishes - if they help you win a big contract, show them how much the company appreciates their effort: reward them in the form of tickets for their favorite band’s concert or match. After all, small things make people truly happy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that none of these tactics will work for you, you can always resort to some perks companies usually offer to their employees. Flexible working hours, free lunches, play rooms with table soccer or the possibility to bring a pet to work are just some of the things that can keep employees happy. Whatever the way, just show to them that you really care about them. As a result, their gratitude and loyalty will be evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the Nine Most Important Time Management Principles&lt;/strong&gt; for you to use, and for you to promote and use with your department, team, area, zone or gang of co-workers. However you’re diving them up, it helps to keep on top of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=451882&quot;&gt; Team Goals&lt;/a&gt;. Department Goals. Professional Goals. Personal Goals. At every level, you need to have a perfectly clear idea, in mind, or on the wall, of where you’re going. Managing priorities is a lot easier, and so is arriving where you’re hoping to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2) Lists Need to Drawn Up **
Learn to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3026738/work-smart/5-ways-to-make-your-to-do-lists-more-effective&quot;&gt;manage multiple to-do lists&lt;/a&gt;. Keep them clean and layered but keep them every day. Priorize—according to your goals—and according to whatever you system you prefer. You can use software or a simple lettering or numbering system. But don’t neglect your lists and don’t let anyone else neglect them either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Distractions Need to be Managed&lt;/strong&gt;
Tasks need to scheduled, (see above) with &lt;a href=&quot;http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/work-interrupted-6-ways-to-avoid-distractions-hot-jobs/article.aspx&quot;&gt;regard to your biggest distractions&lt;/a&gt;. Time management means eliminating, overcoming or, simply better managing all the things that are going to keep you from your goals. Chats, emails and phone calls all take their toll. So do favors, anxiety, and extra-curriculars of all kinds. Set limits and designate times for attending to all of them—say 15 minutes for every two hours you’re working on actual goals. You really can deal with everything in that short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Priorities Are Openly Discussed&lt;/strong&gt;
Those priorities that are developed in pursuit of your goals need to be taken very seriously. And depending on the level (professional, departmental, etc.), they also should be discussed in depth with the relevant people. Personal goals are better understood when they’re bounced off your best friend. Team priorities might involve the whole team or the leadership. In every case, priorities that overlap or affect other people should be discussed and developed with those same people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Inflows Need to Be Managed&lt;/strong&gt;
This is a big one. We’ve all had situations where we just can’t say no. We’ve also been in situations where we really can’t delegate and where micro-managing every detail is the only way to get anywhere. Time management means not only managing the people you’re delegating too, but also managing how much you’re taking on. Saying yes to everything sometimes means saying no to realism. Be realistic and learn to solve other people’s problems without doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Busy All the Time Does Not Equal Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;
Anyone can be busy. Likely, some of the least productive people in your organization are busy. Many of them will brag about the multi-tasking they’re doing. Don’t fall for it. Working smart takes less time, less stress and a lot less energy. Manage busy-body tasks just like you manage distractions. Some of them will be necessary. Don’t let them interfere with the goals and the priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Breaks are Mandatory - For Good Reason&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-time-management-revolution/&quot;&gt;Group breaks do work for groups&lt;/a&gt;. Hard-breaks, out of the office, walks, coffee or TV; all these things will work and will do more for your focus than worry or stress. Schedule the same as you schedule checking your email, and managing other distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the whistle blows, you should be able to see your accomplishments in the crossed off lists, and even check back over many weeks or months. All of these things work better than a Windows folder full of documents or an abstract recollection of “what you did.” Make it hard. Make it real. You’ll see the results and so will your team.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apart from money, which is believed to be the best motivator for employees, there are a lot of other methods a successful and experienced manager can use to motivate his team. Furthermore, some accomplished and successful leaders will tell you that certain non-cash approaches are even more effective than money stimulations when thinking in the long run.

Your employees work hard to make your whole team and company succeed and you as the leader should be the one that motivates them and brings the positive energy to the team. It is important to keep your worries and feelings out of the way because your stress and problems can cause your team members to panic.

&lt;p&gt;•    Recognize and reward hard workers. There are a lot of ways to praise the hardest working employees in your team and very often they cost nothing except a few minutes of your time. Send occasional emails to those employees or take a few minutes of their time during breaks or meetings to share your appreciative note with them. Honor your best employees by having them in the spotlight for some time thus showing to the rest of the team that hard work pays off. Sometimes even a simple pat on the back goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    Always keep your door open and be a good listener. When the tough times come, which is sometimes inevitable, and your team gets all nervous, it is your responsibility to keep your employees focused and motivated.  Keep your office door open for them and always dedicate some time for each of your team members to address their issues and concerns. Keep in mind that everybody handles stress in different ways, so get to know your employees the best way you can. It will help you manage both your team and stress in a proper manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•    Put your employees first and help them fulfill their career goals. In order achieve success in business you must have a good team behind you. Hiring and managing the right people is one of the highest priorities in any type of business. They are your engine that will take you to the path of success.

Build your employees’ loyalty by setting a personal example of work ethics and hard working. Don’t hesitate to show your best employees you value their efforts and exceptional work and they will stay around for a long time.

   <title>Interview Tips and Techniques</title>
   <link href="/blog/interview-tips-techniques/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-11T06:23:30-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/interview-tips-techniques</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being asked to an interview is great news by itself yet there is a long way in front of you before you actually get the job. In order for you to win this final round, we have prepared a couple of tips and techniques that will enhance your interview performance and professionalism and boost your chances of getting hired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the interview make sure to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do a company research&lt;/strong&gt; - take your time to gather background information about the company you are applying for. This should be your top priority while preparing for the interview because letting your potential employer know that you are familiar with the company’s past, present, and future will be a big plus for you. It will not only show to him that you are truly interested in the working position but it will also make the interview more interactive. The starting point for this research could be the company’s website, more specifically, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/about-us/&quot;&gt;“About us”&lt;/a&gt; page, where one can learn what a company actually does. While browsing the company’s website, try to find the “Our mission” or “Our story” page as well because you could learn about the company’s visions and goals on those pages. Incorporating them in your response to the usual question “Why do you want to work for our company?” might impress your interviewer and differentiate you from other interviewees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/interview-tips-techniques.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/interview-tips-techniques-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interview tips and techniques&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust your resume to the position you are applying for&lt;/strong&gt; - in particular, emphasize your skills, values and strengths that would be an asset to the targeted company. Aligning your CV to the position in question can be one of the most successful interview techniques if you manage to highlight your skills and abilities that will contribute to the company’s success. Think of all your previous accomplishments from different aspects of your life, analyze them and identify the ones that could be related to the requirements of the new working post. If the results were positive, be ready to talk about them, paying special attention to the situations that would showcase the successful usage of the mentioned skills and competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice and simulate the interview&lt;/strong&gt; - this is one of the best interview tips and techniques because while practicing for the interview, either with a friend or in front of a mirror, you will gain confidence, reduce interview anxiety and sharpen your communication skills. At this stage of the interview preparation, try to anticipate what questions you will be asked and devise the most optimal answer. Having this role-played interview video-recorded is worthwhile as it can show some non-verbal aspects of your performance - your body language, voice, attitude, all of which can be corrected for the grand finale - the real interview for the job itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep in mind that t&lt;strong&gt;he first 30 seconds of the interview matter most&lt;/strong&gt; - in other words, it will take your interviewer only 30 s to form an opinion about your personality and intelligence and, consequently, whether or not you will fit into the team. Therefore, be prepared to sell yourself for that limited time and remember that your appearance, attitude and body language are of vital importance.
•    Select your outfit carefully, taking into consideration the company’s dress code. You will never make a mistake if you stick to business-like attire - something conservative and neat.
•    Introduce yourself in a firm voice, smile occasionally and maintain good eye contact
•    Sit upright and rest your arms on the arms of your chair. Avoid leaning back and crossing your arms. Do not cross your legs but put both your feet on the floor. If you are nervous, hold a pen or pencil.
•    Be pleasant, polite and sincere. Participate in the conversation and do not hesitate to ask for clarification.
•    Prepare a couple of questions that you would like ask the hiring manager. After all, an interview is a two-way conversation in which both parties assess each other’s fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-up with a thank you e-mail&lt;/strong&gt;, reminding the interviewer of your values and skills at the same time showing to him that you are interested in the job and you are ready to take an initiative to get it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have followed these interview tips and techniques, you can expect a call-back from the hiring manager informing you that you actually got the job. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>8 Points to a Recruitment Policy that Works for More than Candidates</title>
   <link href="/blog/recruitment-policy/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-08T00:31:29-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/recruitment-policy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![Recruitment Policy for Hiring](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Recruitment-Policy.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Recruitment-Policy.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**When you consider all the possible consequences, on-boarding should be just as scary as off-boarding.  
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve written a lot, here, about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employment-brand/&quot;&gt;your employment brand&lt;/a&gt; and about making your employees into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-advocates/&quot;&gt;broader advocates for your entire business&lt;/a&gt;. But what about branding yourself right from the initial recruitment policy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way, even the candidates passing you by get an idea of who and what you are - and you should see better candidates taking more interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-point-to-recruitment&quot;&gt;What is the Point to Recruitment?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your entire organization may need to sit up and take notice. It’s not just a matter of Human Resources having a finger on the pulse of the job market. On the contrary, recruitment policy is also a matter of actively maintaining your company’s presence in the broader jobs market, and in a sense, in the broader marketplace. That’s no small potatoes. Here’s what your stated policy needs to include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1: Maintaining and augmenting an adequate pool of qualified candidates is an ongoing project.&lt;/strong&gt;
** 2: Minimizing the cost of interviewing and on-boarding by optimizing the qualifying process for candidates.**
** 3: Retaining employees, once they’re onboard, so that you’re not continually losing money on recruiting, hiring, orienting and training.**
** 4: Meeting all outside and social obligations**
** 5: Identifying and work with appropriate sources for candidates**
** 6: Reviewing what works and eliminating redundancies**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what an active, dynamically driven policy - manned by an engaged team - should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;these-eight-points-are-designed-to-get-your-recruitment-team---and-your-entire-organization---back-on-its-feet&quot;&gt;These Eight Points are Designed to Get Your Recruitment Team - and your entire organization - back on its feet.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Process are only Processes so long as they are continually being improved.&lt;/strong&gt;
Your recruiters need to be continually in tune with the best in the business and continually learning from them. This is more well-known in IT circles but there’s no reason it can’t give your organization the best darn recruiting process in the world. Always be tweaking. Look at the best practices of other organizations and see what you can change in your own. Don’t mess with success, but be honest when an idea falls flat and seek out alternatives paths to the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2. Talk to Everyone and Anyone - including Candidates
**You know what they want. They know you know. Give them the straight up. If they aren’t qualified, tell them how to get qualified. Answer your phone and start talking and make transparency as much a part of your team as it in the rest of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Social is Happening Now&lt;/strong&gt;
Don’t keep waiting. Social recruiting is all about what’s happening right now and it’s only going to get better. Employee referrals are among the very best referrals you’re going to get. So, even if you’re company Facebook page is still embarrassing, it’s going to pay to look into getting more out of (almost) all of the places online where your current employees are hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Build a Means for Staying in Touch.&lt;/strong&gt;
Even if you don’t have current positions, better people want to know more. Just like your sales teams sells your products and services, your recruitment team needs to maintain relationships, sometimes for the long-lead sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5. Review for Suitability
**Only your managers are going to understand requirements. But managers in constant need of new hires are missing something. Either on the retention side, or on the side of competencies, someone needs to review what’s creating the need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;
This one seems to often get glossed over, but work with marketing to see that your brand and your message are clear and attractive. Even in the simplest Help Wanted ad, your Brand is out there and it needs to be polished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Build Networking Into the Policy&lt;/strong&gt;
Recruiters tend to be good network-ers. But that’s not always true of everyone else in your organization. Do they know when new candidates are sought? Wouldn’t they like to? In most cases a sound policy that encourages recruiting will work to your advantage, and lots of folks are more than happy to lend a hand in the recruitment process. But they’ve got to know where you stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Respect&lt;/strong&gt;
Branding goes nowhere if you haven’t got respect for everyone involved in the process. And respect can mean answering all the right questions, or it can mean working towards complete and open transparency. In every case, you owe it to the candidates, qualified, vetted or disqualified to make the process as open as possible. Respect may require some documentation, but that’s there for both sides too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revise away.&lt;/strong&gt; The recruitment game is not going to get any easier and it’s not going to go away. But in every case, you’re stated policy needs to be a dynamic, always ready to revise document that grows as quickly and easily as the group of people working for and with your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ideal Employees are Among Us</title>
   <link href="/blog/ideal-employees-among-us/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-07T22:10:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/ideal-employees-among-us</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having top-quality employees in a team or an organization is one of the most desired assets. Recognizing the ideal employee in one’s work environment, or being aware of the qualities of a good employee, is something that should be a goal for any corporate HR team. Although everyone is an individual, certain characteristics can be acknowledged as being common to all great workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/workshop.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/workshop-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Easy employee scheduling workshop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every worker is expected to be competent, as knowing his job is being one of the prerequisites for getting the job in the first place. In other words, we can say that possessing profound knowledge of the industry is a mandatory skill, yet not the one that differentiates a good from an ideal employee. The ideal employee is not satisfied with the knowledge alone – he is eager to enhance the already possessed skills and is willing to learn new things and techniques. Especially the ones that will help him broaden their current expertise. He follows the latest trends in the industry, either by attending seminars and workshops, or by reading trade magazines. By doing so, he becomes a more valuable member to both, their team and to their managers. And as a result, new job opportunities arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apart from being skillful, the ideal employee is also characterized by a certain set of interpersonal skills. The ones that are in demand among most HR representatives include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• teamwork - the principle of a machine, composed of cogs and gears that make it run smoothly, can also be applied to an organization because it consists of teams, whose members are responsible for keeping that machine (company) run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• outstanding communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and great eloquence - presenting one’s thoughts in a clear manner, both in writing and speaking is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• commitment, responsibility and reliability are some of the most wanted qualities of a good employee. They make a triad of the behavioral traits that relieve the manager to a great extent, helping him focus more on his tasks and not needing to constantly supervise his subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• rapport - maintaining good relationships with other co-workers, such as showing courtesy and respect as well as offering help, creates a better working atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• punctuality - needless to say, time is money. Every employer wants his/her employees to respect the working hours. The virtue of coming to work on time and leaving at the scheduled time is highly appreciated by employers and is tacit to dedicated and committed workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nimble-schedule-clock-out-app.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nimble-schedule-clock-out-app-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Clocking Smart Phone App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A software solution that can help one become even a more efficient worker is called NimbleSchedule. Through a very simple and straightforward process, employees can select the position they were in charge of during a particular day or shift along with a particular job code (optional). Everything can be done via one’s computer or smartphone as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clock-in/Clock-out is a user-friendly time-attendance feature of this popular scheduling software. To start a shift, one simply logs into the NimbleSchedule account and on the page Time-Clock, clicks the Clock-in button. Indicating the end of the shift is equally easy. On the same page, one clicks the Clock-out button and, optionally, selects the position and the job code for that particular day and/or shift. If enabled by the employer (administrator), the option Shift report can be filled out by the employee.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Profile of the Ideal Manager</title>
   <link href="/blog/profile-ideal-manager/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-04T08:01:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/profile-ideal-manager</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although every one of us has his or her own picture of an ideal manager, some of the preferred traits do overlap thus making defining of the ideal manager key skills easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The starting point for such an endeavor can always be knowing exactly what the responsibilities and obligations of the manager are. Something that is implied is the manager’s expertise and competence, that is to say, his ability to get the job done while applying the highest possible standards. Yet, there are many more underlying subtle factors indicating whom we may call an exceptional manager, an excellent supervisor or a good team leader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to work in a positive work environment with an established code of conduct which implies, among other things, fair treatment of all the employees. Therefore, a perfect leader will build effective relationships, the ones based on respect and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The times when managers were just order-issuing authorities are bygone. Nowadays, in order for one to be a respected and efficient manager, it is recommended to assume the role of a coach, the duty of whom is to motivate his subordinates, encourage them in their improvement at the same time showing empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/the-manager-as-a-coach.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/the-manager-as-a-coach-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The manager as a coach&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing strong bonds between the leader and his followers and nourishing the cult of mutual trust and understanding is something that should be aspired to within any organization. It should be listed in the desired skill sets for managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In almost all work environments, conflicts are inevitable. The catch is how to diminish them to the least extent possible, if not to eradicate them totally. An experienced manager will be able to find proper ways and means to deal with them. The causes and reasons for conflicts can be diverse, ranging from having so many different personalities at one place to misunderstandings about assigned shifts and/or tasks. A true leader will possess the manager key skills that will enable him to overcome all the possible conflict situations. Some of those skill sets for managers will be innate and some acquired. Frequently, challenging situations can also be prevented by utilizing efficient software solutions, such as NimbleSchedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule enables managers to spend less time scheduling shifts while taking into consideration all of the workforce conditions. Instead of wasting his time on leafing through a notepad, or juggling an excel spreadsheet trying to create an efficient schedule, systems like NimbleSchedule gather and display such information at one place while creating employees’ schedules on the manager’s behalf. A working method like this one gives the manager much more time for other activities and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nimble-schedule-inside-view.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nimble-schedule-inside-view-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nimble Schedule Inside View&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, NimbleSchedule gives more freedom and independence to employees who benefit from an easy and simple access to their working schedules via their computers or smart phones at any time of the day or night. Workers become more satisfied as they get an opportunity to trade shifts with their co-workers, leave time-off requests and pick up the shifts that best fit their everyday obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the flare-ups are under control, team members can focus on achieving the organizational objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the key time-management strategies is “Delegate more”. A good manager is aware of that fact and will act accordingly. Additionally, he will welcome and value new ideas offered by others thus fostering a sense of teamwork. Apart from that, a natural-born leader will lead his employees into new challenges, encourage them to climb the ladder of success and make the most of their knowledge and expertise. Above all, he is a charismatic person who, by his own example, shows to others how to behave in an organization. He is something that is called a true role model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>7 Big Basics of Talent Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/talent-management/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-25T00:12:34-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![talent management](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Talent-Management.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Talent-Management.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Nothing pays off like happy talent! 
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;talent-management-for-everybody&quot;&gt;Talent Management for Everybody&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talent Management remains a paradigm for the dedicated HR professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulled in some 75 other directions, you always—still—need to keep your best people in place. In some real, revolving door industries, they’re going to walk sooner or later, and keeping more of them, longer, makes its own kind of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in lots of other, truly competitive industries, the smart good people are simply too vital to doing business to keep losing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re an old hand or a newby, keep these seven vital points in mind for keeping your vital people in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transparency&quot;&gt;1 - Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of the articles we publish here include some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/management-of-telecommuters/&quot;&gt;appeal for workplace transparency&lt;/a&gt;. While workplace transparency really can’t be &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-02-21/news/47559563_1_best-workplace-good-workplace-job-satisfaction&quot;&gt;overemphasized&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still a long term goal and not something that can get implemented and rolled out like a new software platform. But a lack of open, ongoing communication between any organization and its constituent members, employees, talent, etc. is always a recipe for failure. If you’re not a front organization, laundering money for organized crime, then there is no good excuse for increasing your transparency. If you don’t work towards more transparency then you will be perceived as a a front organization, laundering money for organized crime —by at least some of your people. There are simply those two choices. Perception really is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;c-suite-support&quot;&gt;2 - C-Suite Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this doesn’t mean a room filled with cigar-smoke behind a battered back-alley door. But it should mean some careful consideration of exactly how you are regularly presenting the steps of your plan. You’re not meeting with the mafia, even if it sometimes seems that way. Forget the way HR people talk and focus on performance goals, specific talents and numbers. Starting out might mean everything is about the cost of turnover and continually training new hires. Strategy and deliverable results depend on the numbers you can get your hands on, so get them and understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;3 - Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results should be clearly understood before you go into the C-Suite - or you start banging on that steel door from the alley. Understanding clearly what, exactly, the business is gaining is vital. It needs to be clearly connected with the strategy you’re proposing. This is where fooz-ball tables and pizza parties really fall flat. Forget about them. &lt;strong&gt;Everything else, below, is about strategy&lt;/strong&gt;, so implementation, documenting costs and benefits and a realistic time frame for implementing strategy are the results you’re suggesting here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ongoing-feedback&quot;&gt;4 - Ongoing Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be an automated, big, and essential part of your strategy. It’s also, frequently, a thrill for your star talent. Believe it or not. Performance reviews are ok, but they’re often &lt;strong&gt;too infrequent, too formal **and&lt;/strong&gt; too threatening**. From this point on, HR is a facilitator of conversations between juniors and seniors about how BOTH are doing. There are enough tools available that you can, and should, make these things automatic, ongoing and continual. And don’t fake the fun. Star performers can call your bluff, and they will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-culture-on-the-table&quot;&gt;5 - Put Culture on the Table&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not enough space here to really elaborate “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/change-workplace-culture/&quot;&gt;workplace culture&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s a big, soft word and most of what HR and coaching and talent people say about it is wrong. But put it on the table. Again, if you’re not a mafia-front, then it’s already a real thing. Think about it. Think about what kind of people you have, what they like and what they do. Remember, some tremendous part of culture is also “aspirational” —funny enough, just like your best people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stars-not-talents&quot;&gt;6 - Stars!  (not Talents)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you should know, performance is everything. Talent may very well be something that neither you nor even an immediate supervisor really understands. How’s your Django? PostgreSQL+? PostGIS / Mysql? Forget about it. Those are individual skills. Are they working for the supervisor? Are they in-line with the department level goals? Discussions start with the team leaders. These early discussions revolve around performance. How to recognize it, encourage it and how to identify those who perform. The attributes of those star performers—and even some attributes not directly connected with performance—are what we’re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;include-the-entire-future&quot;&gt;7 - Include the (Entire) Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; In your communications, in your conversations and in your strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counter-intuitive though it may seem, looking at where your employees WANT TO GO is as important as looking at where they are. And continually focusing on where we’re at is just not what star performers are going to want to do. Career ladders, opportunities and networking communities are all part of managing the best people. They’re also part of turning lackluster performers into stars. Don’t neglect the aspirations of anyone you’re interested in keeping in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s an essential we really left out, just point it out in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rebranding your Employment Brand: 7 Essentials</title>
   <link href="/blog/employment-brand/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-18T00:58:21-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employment-brand</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![employment brand](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rebranding-employment-brand.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rebranding-employment-brand.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Polishing up never stops, but reaching a true shine is more important than ever!  
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convincing the C-suite that a re-branding is even necessary is the hard part. Especially when the C-suite only vaguely knows what a brand is. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An employment brand—just like a consumer brand—is a super hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the persona imagined in the minds of all your workers. For most employees, it’s something of a villain. Employees will tolerate Lex Luther—for a time. Some of them will stay months and some for years, but everyone, everywhere, working for Lex Luther is looking to make a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much in any area in your human resources day, this one could call for close consultation with your marketing area. But what you say? You don’t have a marketing area? Your marketing area refuses to work with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ever the case, this is a brief over view of what is to be done to brand, re-brand or salvage your good name - as an employer. The ultimate point is to paint an image - and to back it up - as a terrific place to work, and to stay and plan your future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The C-suite, very often, has no idea why that would not be the case.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Figure Out the Brand (super hero) that your Company Is and Should Be.&lt;/strong&gt;
We don’t have to go crazy here. You can personify your brand if you need to. But you should see here, already, why thinking and working with creatives is so important to this project. You don’t need to be ridiculous. “Insurance Man” probably won’t work, though a company like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketsmithinc.com/2013/09/brand-week-geico/&quot;&gt;Geico might be able to get away with it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But brainstorming, and understanding, the brand your people work for, and with, and about, does not require seriously advanced creative training or experience. On the contrary, you can imagine from a purely paternalistic point-of-view what that “hero” looks like, acts like and represents. That paternalism may not be your best friend, it may be completely contrary to the relationship you want to establish. In many cases, the paternal character is, in fact, too overbearing, too inflexible. So, imagine the hero that your brand really can be and flesh her out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Recruit with Your Super Hero in Mind&lt;/strong&gt;
For some companies running lots of help wanted ads, this one can get going quickly. Start changing your ads. HR should go directly to marketing, to your agency, or to the more loosely defined people doing whatever kind of marketing you’re doing. Concise, clear messaging that hits all the right super-hero themes is essential to not only getting the right people, but also to welcoming them into a culture that is already established and worthy. The best people are going to not only expect this level of awareness, but they know their own worth, too. Culture and brand need to run straight through from recruitment to on-boarding to day-to-day work. Help wanted ads should be written with sales copy that draws carefully, and prolifically from established brand standards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get strong C-suite Backing&lt;/strong&gt;
A few good employees walking out is usually necessary to actually get upper-management to take notice. Reviewing the actual hard numbers of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-turnover-costs/&quot;&gt;employee turnover is costing you&lt;/a&gt; is often another good way to wake up the beast. Do it. Stand your ground and work with marketing to present what employees perceive now and what they should be perceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Align with your Bigger Brand Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;
Remember, your employment brand overlaps heavily with what you’re selling to your market. That’s why it’s crucial to work with those developing your broader brand and marketing message. This can seem more difficult for those working strictly B2B or with “boring” products or services. Sales people do it, everyday, so you may want to work with them too. They’re not only used to embodying your brand, but they dedicate themselves to personifying your brand, representing it and bringing it to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. On-Board—with Super-Hero Deft, Heft and Style&lt;/strong&gt;
This should not be cheap gifts. It should mean a complete folder full of essential documents. A follow up meeting with the appropriate people is essential and these can and should include, benefits administrators, insurance administrators and if you can include someone else to make sure that your new hire is totally comfortable with everything that confronts him or her, then you’re in business. If a computer and email account can’t be had, new hires are going to understand. But leaving them alone to wonder how and when these essential are going to be provided is an ugly black mark on your employment brand. So get it straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Now Re-Board ALL existing employees.&lt;/strong&gt;
This usually can’t be done in one day or even in one week. But re-branding also means “acculturating,” and that can mean listening, offering support, investigating and communicating. In short, it’s all those things that Human Resources is not often very good at doing. Ask, learn, and get all the valuable information you’re going to need for developing &lt;strong&gt;Super-Hero Employment Brand 2.0.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s that big and important of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Get Super-Hero to Focus on Employees’ Futures&lt;/strong&gt;
Not the bottom line. Not the individual department level goals. If every employee can clearly see their future - inside this company, then HR has done it’s employment branding job! It can seem like a long term project. It can even seem counter-productive, training some employees to take off for other jobs and careers. But training even one employee—and seeing him or her off graciously—will put a polish on your brand like few other things. Support people, not income, and you will never lack for people bringing in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a long term project, and not always the easiest one for HR people to see. Make and keep friends all over, especially in marketing and sales. But HR’s job is still to listen to everyone and to nurture a culture worth being a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>9 steps to Effective Leadership Training for Managers</title>
   <link href="/blog/effective-leadership/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-11T00:01:53-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/effective-leadership</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![effective leadership management](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/effective-leadership.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/effective-leadership.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Effective leadership means really meeting lots of people half-way, not something you learn in an MBA program. 
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sometimes-effective-leadership-comes-down-to-managers-who-can-learn&quot;&gt;Sometimes Effective Leadership comes down to Managers who can learn.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps everyone’s had that job where they simply promote the “last person not to quit” into a management role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the remaining new recruits quit, too, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanresources.about.com/od/badmanagerboss/a/10-more-dumb-things-managers-do.htm&quot;&gt;everything returns quickly to normal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no picnic. Lot’s of companies hemorrhage money and talent simply because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askamanager.org/2012/05/why-are-employers-so-bad-at-training-people.html&quot;&gt;new managers receive no training&lt;/a&gt;, run &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; leadership campaigns and basically just blindly follow some kind of presumed management blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not good for the managers. It’s terrible for the employees. The money? Well, you can pretty well guess how companies losing in all these areas will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Nine Steps—when followed, re-interpreted, and adjusted for your own management mission—will improve your management team’s performance across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Get Started Coaching&lt;/strong&gt;
All management is coaching, all coaches are managers. Correcting and instructing on behaviors and motivations doesn’t take genius. It does take commitment and motivation. Get new managers to accept it and to love it. It doesn’t require a cigar-chomping bully, but a true understanding and an emotional connection. See also, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/team-building/&quot;&gt;7 Basic Team Building Tips&lt;/a&gt; - even if you’re not in HR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Spell Out Emotions&lt;/strong&gt;
Some emotions are necessary. Not crying or screaming. But good managers love what they do. They may be obsessive, they should be involved in all kinds of forums and discussion groups and LinkedIn groups and they should be staying up late sometimes just to love it more. That’s an appropriate emotion. Inappropriate emotions, like too much excitement, or over-investment, need to be discussed. Cool indifference might seem like it’s always the answer. But managers need to be self-motivated and for that, a healthy discussion of loves, hates, passions and disappointments is not going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Build Managers&lt;/strong&gt;
Regular readers know that this blog has no patience for conference rooms, meetings of more than three and regular meetings of any kind. But you should have at least some classroom style training for new managers. These are not just orientation and policy briefs. On the contrary, new managers need to be transitioned, trained and directed. Pairing a new manager with an experienced mentor is also a good idea. Building managers means, also, dealing with resentment, and any kind of friction or turmoil at the staff level. Relationships are everything, and good coach-managers know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Build Teams&lt;/strong&gt;
Strengths and weaknesses don’t come to light over night. And teams are not just another name for a bunch of otherwise un-related players. New Managers need to learn individual skills, understand processes and, where necessary, learn to navigate the gauntlet of competing interests, passions and motives. Goals should be enunciated and continually called up for revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Figure Out Meaningful Goals&lt;/strong&gt;
But now, goals need to be not just your own, much less those of the company, but most importantly, the goals of the individual players. All of them want something. What is it? Coaching managers means coaching the coaches of all those individuals—and effective leadership here is going to mean assisting all those players in reaching their own goals. Get those people moving to where they want to go, on the job, and off, and you are very much back in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Develop Skills&lt;/strong&gt;
Very often, a new manager will move to the top of a room where she’d been on one side. Thereafter, she needs to learn something of the skills that were being used—on the other side of the same room. See #2 above. This is where some passion can really help out. Your manager doesn’t need to master new skills. But, for example, coaching people running different computers and programs requires taking interest. Getting involved. Learning a little. Talking to team players about weaknesses, problems, and what they need and want is essential to developing the sensitivity necessary for management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Establish a Presence&lt;/strong&gt;
Oddly, lots of managers are timid people. Lots more are perfectly agreeable people, but they’re pulled away to all kinds of “meetings” and other time-wasting activities. But work with new managers on where they are, how available they are or need to be, to the people they’re managing. Managing multiple shifts can require straddling the two - but the important thing is to be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Establish a Documentation Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;
This can very often get neglected in the early tenure of any new manager. Work with trainee managers to see how records of team performance and achievements are documented. This will very often fall to an assistant or office manager, but especially with larger teams, a lot will get lost in a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Recognize Excellence&lt;/strong&gt;
This is one more reason why good records are so important. Good managers should be trained to review performances and to recognize achievements and to do it regularly. Achieving and exceeding goals is terrific, but it can come to nothing for lots of team members. If there is no reward and recognition process in place, managers fail. While quarterly recognition is nice, biannual or annual performance reviews can, and should, make a terrific incentive for everyone on the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you doing to recognize, coach and train new managers? Let us know in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Schedule Maker's Answer: 7 Good Reasons to Offer More Flexible Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/schedule-maker/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-04T00:29:09-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/schedule-maker</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![schedule maker](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/schedule-maker.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/schedule-maker.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Flexible scheduling makes even stoic employees jump for joy.
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-schedule-makers-look-at-why-employees-want-flex-time&quot;&gt;A schedule maker’s look at why employees want flex-time.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers very often look at flexible scheduling for all kinds of reasons. It’s not difficult to look around the internet and find &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2013/06/19/flexible-work/&quot;&gt;all kinds of reasons&lt;/a&gt; for implementing your own program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult to see that they’re after high quality charges who are leaders in their respective fields—and who simply aren’t going to tolerate some old school calendar posted on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But understanding flexibility means more than simply instituting the option and appreciating the great work your newly engaged employees are now doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although NimbleSchedule is designed to easily adapt to the needs and conditions set by your human schedule maker, we have seen some flexible scheduling nightmares. The point of this article to highlight what the worker experiences so that you can adjust your own scheduling as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Better coordinate across time zones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of business writers just stick the word “Global” in there to sound important, but even small businesses are often relying on far away contractors or employees. Now you’re asking one team to stay late, and another is waiting until morning. Before you know it you’re paying over time because somebody somewhere is, well, waiting. Let the same people flexibly schedule on or off the clock and you’ve got fans for life willing to work - or not work - all night and into the wee hours of morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Better live like humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working regular business hours is living the life of a zombie. Every single thing your people need to do needs to be coordinated with a home office that very quickly starts to feel like a ball and chain. Adding even a little bit of flexibility to that nightmare existence immediately loosens the chains that strangle creativity, that destroy loyalty and fuel resentment. So, if you’re back fresh on Monday morning with a crowd of listless, disloyal and distracted, resentful people, ask yourself; “why am I ruining these people’s lives with my 19th century scheduling technique?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Better Commuting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing of organizing entire cities and regions to travel at the same two “Rush Hours” of each day was ridiculous. Car driving is not exactly &lt;a href=&quot;http://tranbc.ca/2012/10/10/7-secrets-to-taming-driver-stress/&quot;&gt;good for mental health anyway&lt;/a&gt;, but driving everyday through the same gauntlet of congested and frustrating commuter neighborhoods is downright dis-spiriting. So are crowded buses, subways and train-stations. Flexible scheduling is not just good for your employees’ mental health, it shows your company’s commitment to the community and to the wider world. Take a position on commuting, and encourage public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Better Time Keeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appointments, kids, practices, sessions, meetings. Everything in your life gets delayed when you have to run it through the office schedule maker’s compliance rules. Give your people back a little time - during normal business hours - and you’ll be rewarded. Loyalty, even devotion, come from employees who are allowed to responsibly look after their families and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/continuous-improvement/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Continuous improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually one we talk a lot about here. Try to cement this one into place in your head: &lt;strong&gt;Employees Want their Workplace to Be Always Getting Better.&lt;/strong&gt; They also want their own lives to get better. Connect the two concepts, and you should be making money. You’ve suddenly got growing, dynamic people. You’ve got employees who not only can think about their own loves, educations and futures, but they can devote some of that free time to making your operation more efficient too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Better results during fixed hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hours of fixed-time and four hours of “when-ever time” packs a lot more punch into those fixed time hours. You’ll be amazes how quickly people coordinate so that they can have a little more “when-ever time.”  What they get done will surprise you and please you, and overlapping mandatory fixed times end up making a lot more sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Say Goodbye to Personal Time Off &amp;amp; Sick Days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not entirely, but most organizations who institute even a minimal flextime or flexible scheduling program say goodbye forever to the unpredictability of time-off. Two hours of flexible time, scheduled when you want it, and you’ve got your life back. Crazy how that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an employee, or you’re benefiting yourself from right there in Human Resources, we’d like to know exactly how it’s worked for you, how it’s changed your life - and your job. Please leave us a note in the comments section below.

   <title>9 Reasons to Stomp Out Employee Turnover Costs</title>

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![employee retention](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/employee-turnover.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/employee-turnover.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Sticky beats Turnover, starting at breakfast and lasting all day.
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-turnover-costs-you-more-than-you-think-heres-how&quot;&gt;Employee Turnover Costs You More than You Think. Here’s How.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have had the job, often long in the distant past, where no one is going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throwaway, garbage jobs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/06/20/everything_you_think_you_know_about_the_collapse_of_the_soviet_union_is_wrong&quot;&gt;— at uninspired, Soviet-era companies—&lt;/a&gt; are not only depressing, they’re inefficient, expensive and bad for business. They inspire throwaway relationships with your customers and clients, and make your business into an expendable part of the overall community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeper organizational problems come down to uninspired managers and absent or indifferent owners or stakeholders. Eventually even bad management gets fired, or the parents take the business back from their listless and distracted kids - and everyone is still threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that one engaged manager in the midst of all this turmoil can turn everything around, and very often, it’s the smell of money that will wake sleepy stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact very often, stakeholders have come to assume that &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/labor-costs-percentage-revenue-food-beverage-24800.html&quot;&gt;a company with high turnover will never be profitable&lt;/a&gt; - and that’s in part because high turnover is such an expensive problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, the costs of running a revolving-door operation look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Employees on their way out&lt;/strong&gt; are typically working at anywhere from 25-50% less engagement than their fully engaged peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Immediate supervisors who need to cope&lt;/strong&gt; with the loss are also working less efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Their** fellow employees are also less efficient** due to the distraction of someone walking out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. If the position is open for any length of time,&lt;/strong&gt; the costs of replacing even one employee start to skyrocket. Now you’re looking at temp agencies and overtime pay or simply for someone else to cover for the open position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Productivity of lowered morale&lt;/strong&gt; - not just gossip and frustration, but pure lowered prospects make this a dead-end job, and you better believe lots of eyes are watching the door close behind every employee who leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Now your new hire needs training&lt;/strong&gt;, direction, oversight and you’re still not anywhere near to peak efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of the above are only the soft costs. The hard fixed costs are better known, and generally by more people, especially in the HR area. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/stop-employee-turnover/&quot;&gt;Fixing a toxic company culture&lt;/a&gt; eliminates nearly all of these right from the beginning. These are just the most obvious costs associated with employee turnover but some innovative thinking could eliminate all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your also stuck with…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**6. The costs of recruitment including advertising, interviewing, drug or background checks **and all of the costs of the recruitment side of your HR department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Severance and benefits administration for the now ex-employee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Overtime pay&lt;/strong&gt; for supervisors or anyone else covering the open post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Administrative costs,&lt;/strong&gt; paperwork, exit interviews and termination costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the abbreviated version, too. Your bottom line suffers by these measures and far more, especially when we start looking closely at productivity. NimbleSchedule works closely with all kinds of companies working on today’s business model—and working towards, happier and more engaged, efficient and productive employees. It’s not just about giving flex-time and vacations to your employees and hoping they get it. It’s also about a smarter and more humane workplace that’s really fit for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the level they’re working at, your teams and individual players, will reward you, a million times over, for fixing your morale problems, and your company culture. Make it enough that people want to come in every day, and you’ll also make it profitable. Let us know below what are the biggest costs to high employee turnover and what are you doing to eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Team Building Basics for the Reluctant HR Manager</title>
   <link href="/blog/team-building/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-21T01:16:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/team-building</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![team building exercises](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/team-building.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/team-building.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Team Building is supposed to be fun. So why do so many players head for the bathroom? 
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-and-what-not-to-do-during-your-team-building-activities&quot;&gt;What to Do and What Not to Do During Your Team Building Activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people are talking about better and more effective teams. They’re engaged, professional and efficient—and best of all, they’re not just dependent on one or two stars, but on every single player. Collective initiative and innovation are far more effective—and cohesive—than nearly any other management model. Even if you are operating with an advanced or highly complicated management structure, it all comes down to the teams doing the work.Solo players need not apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are seven of the most important considerations for anyone embarking on a team building project. Keep them in mind and stop back as we continue looking into this important topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Performance Goals Need to Mean Something&lt;/strong&gt;—And not just numbers. Players with different capabilities and background are all going to show up at the table with something different. Give them time—and take the time—to learn what goals should be, to adapt and re-adapt team goals so that they make sense for every individual. Talk openly with the weakest players. Make sure you work those weaker players into interdependent relationships with their stronger counterparts. Don’t let any team member concentrate exclusively on their own tasks or expertise. Rather, re-focus all players on the team goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Put a Decision-Making Process Out There&lt;/strong&gt;—And then make sure everyone sees how it works. That doesn’t mean managers need to cede control. On the other hand, a more transparent decision-making process needs a lot less justification, so they may very well find themselves with better control. So, increasing input into the decision making process is a clear and truly effective team building process in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Get Support from On-High&lt;/strong&gt;—Whether you’re mixing teams of people with different superiors, or you’re simply building a team within a given hierarchy, make sure everyone from first level managers on up gets, get the structure, gets the goals and gets the point. Don’t let any managers undermine the given achievements because of crossed wires or misunderstanding. If you really are taking team players away from other areas or scopes of responsibility, make sure you’re managers are talking. Tasks can be overlooked or forgotten as teams are coming together, especially from multiple areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Diversify&lt;/strong&gt;—And celebrate diversity. Teams work best when they respect all the different players no matter their backgrounds and individual circumstances. The norms established for the team to work with are the norms your team will need to work with, so get them set, right, from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Build Teams Like You’re Hiring&lt;/strong&gt;—That doesn’t mean you have to fire, too. But it does mean, you’re not merely making a a department into a team. Better teams are consciously chosen from people who already have a history of working together (or not working together). Rather than simply calling your department a team, and then trying to do team building exercises. Start with smaller, deliberately chosen teams within a department, and learn from the way that each one succeeds—and fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 6) Plan for Disagreement**—Putting people together at work is a recipe for disaster—in most workplaces. But the attitude that people can’t get along is why many, if not most, teams fail. Dissent shouldn’t just be tolerated but encouraged, and solutions need to be broadly considered, if not carried through to delivery. Many early stages of projects can seem chaotic, expensive or just all over the place. But, like true brain-storming, getting any team across the finish line can mean everyone starting at very different places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Set Up Good Networks&lt;/strong&gt;—Public forums and chats are a team builders best friend. But not if they’re patrolled by the though police. Professionals know how to use networks and what’s appropriate. But they won’t always give you the feedback you need to really draw them in. That’s doubly true if things are unspoken, or worse, unspeakable. Make sure that your team has open and free communication, and an open hand to play their best cards, or you’ll end up with a lot less team to brag about.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The seven HR policies you should NOT be communicating</title>
   <link href="/blog/hr-policies/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-14T01:11:33-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/hr-policies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![HR policy guide](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/HR-Policy.jpg)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/HR-Policy.jpg)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**Sometimes &quot;Old-School&quot; just means &quot;Old&quot;****
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hr-of-fear-and-insecurity&quot;&gt;The HR of Fear and Insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Resources is no picnic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only the lazy and the incompetent communicate that to their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real pro knows that HR is all about the face you put on policy. It’s also about the policies themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-samuel/when-hr-decisions-become-_b_2664001.html&quot;&gt;biggest disasters we’ve seen in terms of effectively communicating policy&lt;/a&gt; - not like a high-school - but like an organization of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you really are painting bad policy in bright colors, take a look at the following. Consider changing what you can, and paint better, explain more, and justify what needs justifying. It’s still better than coming off as authoritarian, or just plain petty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) No WiFi&lt;/strong&gt;
Or worse, private WiFi, but just for some people. All your people have something to do with you on their devices already. The people who are making you the most money need easy access, all the time, to your network and all the goodies on there. There may be some security issues, but your people should be able to work through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) No Working on Outside Projects&lt;/strong&gt;
That’s another reason they need the network, but this one is not so obvious to the higher-ups. It can take some explaining. Companies that are learning need to be developing a wide range of skills. Your people aren’t going to learn them from you. Or from your company. Obviously, you’ve got that non-compete agreement signed and on file, but good people are looking for non-competing projects, in part, so that they can think different. Support them. And spell this one out carefully so that skilled people know that you appreciate their skills - and where you develop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 3) Approval-Crazy**
How about non-qualified approvals? Long outdated approvals? Approvals that hang on way longer than what should have been dismissed went out of styles. Lot’s of managers inherit old approved policies and leave them in place. The same happens with logos and styles and identities and all kinds of things that should never have been “approved” in the first place. Include your teams in reviewing more of your policies and your teams will stick around. If they leave, it means they’re expressing disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;
Even worse, regular meetings. Meetings have gone the way of the time-punch card. They’re a tool for incompetent managers to prove that they can assemble people in a room, even if they can’t get the gang together in a chat room. They waste time, and your talented people will walk out shaking their heads. Organizations need to regularly update people, and discourage formal meetings. Make it known why they are a time-waster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Blocked Up Area Networks&lt;/strong&gt;
This is another red-flag for any employee worth employing. If you work for a company that won’t let you check your personal email, then get out. This hold-over from 1990s’ and y2K virus paranoia is a sign of a company that doesn’t trust anyone and isn’t going anywhere. You can set guidelines for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-advocates/&quot;&gt;how and why use Facebook.&lt;/a&gt; But this whole thing of like, jamming up the Internet with blocked sites makes you look lame. And it makes good people look elsewhere for employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Wage-Slave Time-Off&lt;/strong&gt;
Forget about until it’s actually problem. In the US, you need to track vacation times. But beyond that, you should creatively think up a policy that respects your people and encourages them to come back. 19th Century “sick and personal time” rules show you off as a company from the 19th century. Forget about them, or install something like NimbleSchedule so that you’re at least on the same page as a modern functioning, respectful organization, rather than a hell-hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**7) No Performance Reviews at All ? **
Performance reviews are not only important for the people making you money, they’re vital for leadership too.  If you haven’t established a working feedback mechanism that’s already ongoing, you need to get on the ball. Young workers may grow old under your thoughtful gaze, but the good ones will walk if you’re not listening to them - and they’ll walk if you’re not talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really just the beginning. Get these HR policies fixed, or fixed up, and you’ll be well on your way to not only keeping the right people in place, productive and working. You’ll also be heading towards really breaking even, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>7 Tips for the Employee Schedule Creator in Your Life!</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-schedule-creator/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-07T00:26:16-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-schedule-creator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;table style=&quot;background-color: #ffffff; height: 332px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;[![employee scheduling software](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/employee-schedule-creator.png)](http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/employee-schedule-creator.png)
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;**The Perfect Employee Schedule Creator Should NOT give you a Team of Robots! ****(But it might seem like it sometimes).
**
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-let-your-employee-schedule-creator-make-a-mess-of-your-staffing&quot;&gt;Don’t Let Your Employee Schedule Creator Make a Mess of Your Staffing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seven-tips-for-keeping-things-moving&quot;&gt;Seven Tips For Keeping Things Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, working with the right employee schedule creator should not mean turning your crew into a bunch of robotic zombies. The point is to keep the scheduling managers from going crazy - and to get better results from the people doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling employees is not just writing down names into a complicated calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling manager without a scheduling platform are taking somewhere between one and eight hours every week to schedule employees - in Excel or on paper or anywhere else they can find. We have seen some pretty creative techniques. The problem remains that, when a manager is doing it, it’s just not going to be done to the employee’s liking. It’s not just a matter of preferences either. It’s also a matter of vacation days, legitimate time off and regulations regarding overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it doesn’t really even make sense to have managers doing your scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, letting your employees do it themselves takes some getting used to. These are the seven most important tips we came up with for letting your employees better schedule themselves, and without sending them to the cleaners. Check here if you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laborandemploymentlawcounsel.com/2013/12/to-flex-or-not-to-flex-top-issues-related-to-flexible-workplace-arrangements-and-their-legal-compliance-solutions/&quot;&gt;legal or regulatory concerns.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 1) Structure Your Flex Time**
Not every employee needs 40 hours of flex time. Most of them will like it, but doesn’t mean they won’t do just as well with a day or two. You’ll seem some of them taking advantage of the new hours, but many of them will wait too. Make sure you set restrictions on overtime, if overtime is available and, of course, be sure your scheduler is accurately recording hours on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Make Everything Public&lt;/strong&gt;
This should go without saying, but you may need to spend some time preparing and distributing and even explaining your new procedures, policies and reasoning. Employees get it. Make sure you do your homework and spell out everything clearly. And get employees to acknowledged by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Save Time and Then What&lt;/strong&gt;
Time saving software is like that. You end up spending so much time learning to use it, that, the net gain isn’t realized till many months later. Still - while we can promise that NimbleSchedule is simpler to use than anything else on the market, managers will now also spend time on the points mentioned above, and on better engaging in their jobs, instead of just on scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Forget about Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
Minor changes, sick days, kids’ school or doctor appointments; all of these things add up to an incredible cost in terms of lost time, and especially for the scheduling manager. So here’s your net gain in hours and cost savings. Forget about them. Once the policies are in place and the software is launched your managers can better manage the job at hand and not have to worry about who’s coming in and when. They can always check on their cell phone or on the Internet like everyone else in your shop - even when half your staff is calling off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Autonomize&lt;/strong&gt;
Self Scheduling gives employees a tremendous amount of autonomy. If you’re interested in keeping them, you just did the right thing. The ability to better determine when and where they’ll be “there” - or anywhere - is a huge boost to your ability to keep and grow the relationships that your organization wants to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Consider the implications of 24 hour scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;
Some few new users of NimbleSchedule will consider seriously upping their service hours. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/mar/28/24-hours-business-challenges&quot;&gt;Even fewer will go to full blown 24 hour operations&lt;/a&gt;. But changes to schedules need to be handled, and most of them will be, quickly. Scheduling managers, perhaps obviously, will not only need to adjust to reviewing schedule changes, and the technical aspects of doing so. Very often that means limiting such reviews to once or twice per day, perhaps in the morning and once in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Work on Optimizing Your Message&lt;/strong&gt;
Calendar software is already “automated email software” so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/calendar-software/&quot;&gt;don’t leave your message up to a machine&lt;/a&gt;. On the contrary, seize the opportunity to make every message count and count for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward on a better employee schedule creator is a big step - &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.nimbleschedule.com/categories/20025943-Community-Discussion-Join-the-Conversation&quot;&gt;though our team is always ready to work with you&lt;/a&gt; so that the transition and roll out are ultimately simple and smooth. Is there a tip you wished you’d hear before you rolled out your new scheduling software? Please let us know in the comments below.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-employee-schedule-template&quot;&gt;The Employee Schedule Template&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-beat-all-templates&quot;&gt;to Beat All Templates!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer can bring all kinds of highs and lows to all kinds of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting yours in shape now means more than just downloading a scheduling template and filling it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with a serious human capital management system has become an absolute necessity for anyone managing more than a small handful of employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busier seasons are also an excellent time to see and distinguish between those people really being productive and contributing to the organization, and those who aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;optimizing your labor spend&lt;/strong&gt; means &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/reduce-scheduling-errors/&quot;&gt;knowing who the most productive and reliable people are&lt;/a&gt; - and scheduling them for the hours when they’re needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It also means - cross-training.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, some of your most important functions are going to require a star-player from a lower level, or even from elsewhere in the organization, to step up and be ready to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No old-school employee scheduling template is going to help you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer is like that. Guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those same star players are going to want a break - some of them at the worst possible moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;labor-cost-control-that-makes-sense&quot;&gt;Labor Cost Control That Makes Sense&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most businesses look at the whole question backwards. Keep everyone struggling and working the minimum possible hours and then hopefully you’ll scrape by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe deadbeat employees get the jobs - and the deadbeat bosses - that they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rigorous attention to employee scheduling, and not just a template means working with a comprehensive human capital management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Staying on top of high performing people means letting them go! **
But first you’ve got to know who they are. Maximum productivity means putting the best people where their skills are best used and most valuable. It also lets you keep the overtime to exactly what’s necessary and nothing more - even for the people who want and depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labor compliance used to be a nightmare. And it still is for some employers. But smart bosses know that the systems they put in place can easily manage - and even optimize - workplace schedules and workers so that everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-a-life&quot;&gt;Get a Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better managed schedules mean self-managed schedules, and with your entire crew showing up just when they’re needed and just when they want to be there - you get a crew that is far more productive. It’s also saving you loads of money. Logging vacation or personal days is easy, and it’s almost as rewarding as working someplace that let’s you do it!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, none of this is about so-called “Just-in-Time” scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, using a proper Human Capital Management system, like NimbleSchedule integrated with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/partner-integrations/&quot;&gt;Partner Integrations&lt;/a&gt; we’re pleased to offer, you get schedules that let your employees plan, and plan to stay with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no better talent retention system, (or turn-over reduction plan for that matter) than a plan to give your employees their lives back. Their families, communities and your business will be better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a tip for better scheduling and working with your star players, let us know in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Ways to Lead on Performance Appraisals</title>
   <link href="/blog/performance-appraisals/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-23T00:36:35-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/performance-appraisals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/performance-appraisals.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/performance-appraisals.png&quot; alt=&quot;employee performance appraisal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance-appraisals-start-with-good-leadership&quot;&gt;Performance Appraisals start with Good Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re leading a team, department, group or sub-group, all those Performance Appraisals add up - and they add up to an appraisal of you - as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, every individual performance appraisal reflects not just on the employee being skewered, but on the leadership that employee is subjected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, “subjected to” is exactly the right phrase. If you’re overseeing any number of workers  - be it five or 50 - then carefully directing each and every one of them to a stellar performance appraisal is critical. To your success, to the success of the entire business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But far too often we hear that when it comes down to that all important performance evaluation - alas - everyone is on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave it up to your people to make it on their own. It’s not only bad leadership but it’s a recipe for bad performance, listlessness and time wasting, and frankly, a whole host of other ills that will plague your team right out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, try these 5 simple steps that will get your people not only involved, but succeeding - along with you. Maybe even in front of you… right where you want them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vital-ways-to-engage-all-your-people-before-their-performance-appraisals-come-up&quot;&gt;5 Vital Ways to Engage All Your People Before their Performance Appraisals Come Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Get Critical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously. Formally. Put a constructive criticism mechanism in place and stick with it.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you can take as much feedback as employees can give back and listen to it. Then, be sure that all of the feedback can be reviewed by everyone involve and acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Check Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have everything you need? Remarkable &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-retention/&quot;&gt;how seldom that question gets asked&lt;/a&gt;. Is there something we can give you that will help you to get your job done better? Providing what’s needed gives hope to the hopeless, inspires the listless and lifts spirits everywhere and all around. Watch the motivation happen once the basics are provided for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Learn About Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge debate that’s ongoing - in all corners of business - about Values. Don’t assign them. Listen to them. Learn from them. Celebrate what you really have in common. Better yet - &lt;strong&gt;find out what you have in common&lt;/strong&gt;. Most companies - and even team-mates - don’t know. Have team members work on and develop and understand three things that they really believe in. Do this company-wide, or department-wide, and then compare. Then develop a working list that everyone agrees on and see what happens when you take it public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Go Back to Freelancing!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-disengagement/&quot;&gt;here just a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your employees can’t learn everything they need from inside your company. If they lack curiosity, they also, likely lack engagement!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disengaged employees get bad appraisals and they cost you money. Star players are probably working two or three other gigs - freelance or project-based gigs where they are learning how to do what they do, better. Encourage them, and learn from them. Have them give presentations so that they get practice selling their services - and so that you’re other people are encouraged to develop and sell their skills too. Every department is a mini-service provider with your company as client number one, but you need service providers with a lot of clients. It’s not just about the big, dumb, arrogant company. VALUES!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from everyone might be a good value to start with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Innovate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation doesn’t happen with paranoid conservative leadership. Sorry. Innovation happens with some risk, and a lot of freedom. Read back through all of the above, and review where you can let some of these things happen. Like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you need? More regular time off? Are you ready to give it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing you could learn here is &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;. Are you ready to learn?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we all really agree upon is A. B. C. and the biggest surprise of all, D. Be ready to accept it and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re working on what? How can that possibly relate to us? Again, be ready to be surprised. Most leaders simply are NOT ready!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, we’re taking a risk, giving you what you want so that you can innovate. We’re doing that because we believe you going where you want to go benefits all of us. Now, where are we going?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is a guarantee not only for better employee appraisals, but for management appraisal reports too. What would you do differently? Let us know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Disengagement: 6 Signs the Cranks are Winning</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-disengagement/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-16T00:17:16-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-disengagement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;disengaged-employeeshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201405employee-disengagementpnghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201405employee-disengagementpngis-employee-disengagement-costing-you-a-fortune&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/employee-disengagement.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/employee-disengagement.png&quot; alt=&quot;disengaged employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Is Employee Disengagement Costing You a Fortune?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not working with one of the star employers, in a culture that inspires, and a line of prospective employees heading out the door, then the disengaged employee is probably costing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve assembled these signs of what to watch for when you’re working - on increasing engagement, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_we_develop_a_culture_of_continuous_improvement_in_organizations&quot;&gt;improving your corporate culture &lt;/a&gt;or just generally trying to improve productivity and morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;six-signs-of-employee-disengagement-and-what-to-do-about-them&quot;&gt;Six Signs of Employee Disengagement and What to Do About Them!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Infighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is number one because it’s the most destructive, and seemingly the most intransigent. And importantly it will occur within teams and, more destructively, between departments that should be cooperating. Interdepartmental infighting always wants to escalate to a level where management can properly deal with it, and it often won’t budge. But just like when dealing with teams, departments often work best when they’re forced to work closer together. Very often responsibilities or areas of focus are misunderstood and even assigned to the wrong area. Management has a responsibility to oversee work assignments, and even the dirty details, and often infighting results because management can’t or won’t modify earlier plans that were badly implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Superiority Complexes - and Resulting Excuses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many excuses are bad for everybody. Ever notice that they more often result from some kind of perceived superiority than from any admitted incompetence? More often than not, talented people are also humble, but when it comes to departments or team level esteem, again you can run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like above, look at misdirected responsibilities or inherited areas of influence. Encourage inter-team or inter-departmental dialogue and co-responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**3. Complaints **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any situation of constant dissatisfaction is liable to cause irritation. The resulting mood of continual denigration and negativity quickly spreads. There should be room for disagreement and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/tag/continuous-improvement/&quot;&gt;continuous productive improvement&lt;/a&gt;. But too much complaining is almost always a sign of something much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management needs to decide if the complaining is coming from an individual actor - or from some subset (department/team/area, etc.). Taking reasonable action means confronting the deeper issue, rooting it out and shining some light in there. Admittedly, it can take a thick-skinned manager to go in there. Wear your dragon-hide gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Initiative Vacuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just leadership that should have initiative. Star performers will tell you - what’s wrong and what’s right. They not only know how to get where they’re going, they need encouragement to get there. Herd behavior is simply not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking is the answer and the number of managers who have never asked their charges where they want to go should astound you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Ask. Listen. Help them get there. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Enthusiasm Deficit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should go without saying. You don’t need a squad of cheerleaders. You don’t need balloons, or parties or music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star performers are coming to your place of business - for now - because it leads to somewhere else. Not because it’s fun. They won’t stop coming because it’s not fun. They will stop coming because it doesn’t lead somewhere else, or it just leads to more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again: **Ask. Listen. Help them get there. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. A Freelancer’s Curiosity   … About Everything! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a key tip for management. Your employees can’t learn everything they need from inside your company. If they lack curiosity, they also, likely lack engagement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly for business struggling with practices or procedures or models - you’re probably the last place they should look for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even medium sized business expect that some of their star performers will be working on outside jobs, freelance projects and “lab-rat projects” just to keep themselves learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing an open and transparent policy about when and where they can pursue their outside interests - &lt;strong&gt;and non-competitive lucrative projects&lt;/strong&gt; - is key. If your key players are in demand, it’s undoubtedly better to have them learning on outside projects - and bringing that experience back in - to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-recipe-for-employee-engagement&quot;&gt;The Recipe for Employee Engagement:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Curiosity. Enthusiasm.  Initiative. Tranquility. Humility. And Mutual Support. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might add “mission” in there, along with enthusiasm, right? It sounds more somber. And after all, having a little full on cheerleading is probably not a bad thing. What would you add to the list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>Training Employee Supervisors (in Culture and Everything Else)</title>
   <link href="/blog/training-employee-supervisors/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-09T00:40:12-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/training-employee-supervisors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-supervisor-traininghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201406training-employee-supervisorsjpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201406training-employee-supervisorsjpgtraining-employee-supervisors-is-easy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/training-employee-supervisors.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/training-employee-supervisors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee supervisor training&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Training Employee Supervisors is Easy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-yours-is-an-employee-focused-company&quot;&gt;(if yours is an Employee Focused Company)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve covered in some detail the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/organizational-culture/&quot;&gt;benefits to developing and maintaining a proper culture for your workplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s one more reason: a company with a good culture is smarter.&lt;/strong&gt; The people who make up a good culture simply have more resources to draw upon for solving problems, innovating and breaking new ground!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of talking about playing music and videos for the shop floor, let’s talk about the people overseeing the shop floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your culture can’t go very far if you’ve got troglodytes overseeing your most valuable assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for many companies is that the people who’ve been promoted into these positions are often there with a very conservative mind-set. It’s often one that’s developed over multiple years watching “how things are” and that gets cemented into “how things have to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That makes for a culture that’s not only anti-innovation but often anti-worker, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training and re-training these managers takes determination, and often a full arsenal of resources. But all of these problems are most evident when a culture has developed in isolation  - from both its customer base and from people more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember: All organizations are organized groups of people, first.&lt;/strong&gt; Remembering that is often step one to developing into an organization that is not only healthy, but profitable too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training Employee Supervisors often means spelling that out. But it also means, quite simply, training people in training. Supervising without training is a step against your continuous improvement paradigm and against the culture that’s developing. And like all things cultural, organization culture requires taking advantage of all the means of expression and communication - and sometimes using them in some unorthodox ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;here-are-five-of-the-most-important-ways-to-train-employee-supervisors-for-a-part-in-your-cultural-revolution&quot;&gt;Here are five of the most important ways to Train Employee Supervisors for a Part in Your Cultural Revolution!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Train Supervisors to be TRAINERS:&lt;/strong&gt; We said that above. &lt;strong&gt;Now to emphasize, everyone of your staff supervisors needs to understand their role - in communication, coaching, development, continuous improvement and simple presentation.&lt;/strong&gt; They need to be not only “stars” but performers - not busy meeting-attenders. That’s the old failed way. Showing your organization’s commitment to ongoing training is always going to start with these people - so dinosaurs probably don’t fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-Tool all your Supervisory Staff to be in constant training and development mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Share Articles&lt;/strong&gt; - Healthy cultures rely on shared access to multiple sources of information. Your supervisor’s boss is not a source for information. Lots of business cultures rely on compliance to nix lots of good ideas. Formalizing article sharing doesn’t often lead to good results, but open and ongoing conversations do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t confuse compliance with skills.&lt;/strong&gt; Compliance people are necessary, but they should only say yes/no based on company policy. That’s not a skilled position on business - no matter what your business is. Skilled people have to make decision based on a much wider range of experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Podcast Everything:&lt;/strong&gt; It might sound ridiculous, but their oh-so-important meetings are just a way that dinosaurs avoid learning (and often avoid working for the organization). Modern companies have abolished meetings and talk instead. A multitude of training and development podcasts can be listened to, and should be used to keep your dinosaurs on their toes. Get into the habit of receiving reports on what was learned from this week’s podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember, if your supervisory people have only studied your company to get where they are, they are useless to you. They need to be retrained to take the best from elsewhere in your industry and everywhere in every industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Conference &amp;amp; Webinar Recordings:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, to lots of cynical minds they sound ridiculous. But assigning one recording to a few people, and having them report on key points is cheaper and far more useful than traveling around the country to conferences and conventions. Streaming or tape delayed conference sessions help you cut through the expense and the time, and . One tactic I use is to ask each team member to watch a different session then report back to the rest of the team at an upcoming meeting with information on the session and the key learning points. If it seems valuable to the larger group, it can than easily be added to each person’s development plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very often, just being recognized as part of an “Industry” is a huge shot in the arm for supervisory staff and for employees more generally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) High Culture: &lt;/strong&gt;This can mean sports, it can mean the street, even religion or church. All of these things add up to just people. Of course, higher culture tends to mean less controversy. Doubtless few of your people are really going to be authorities on opera. That makes opera a fair place to start. Learning a little bit about it - with all of  your people - opens up the entire organization to “learning.” It also provides a neutral place where no one is an authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just like people, organizations need to “learn how to learn” too&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s often a difficult task to even begin and asking your supervisors to learn can be like asking them to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a “People-First” company is not only a good policy for a good corporate culture. It’s also a way to put your customers - and star employees - in first place. Bring that topic up with your compliance people. Let us know in the comments section below how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Multi Timezone Employee Scheduling Coverage</title>
   <link href="/blog/timezone-shift-planning/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-06T12:17:29-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/timezone-shift-planning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing a team in a single office or in the same town is a fairly easy and simple process. All you need to worry about is your employees being notified about their schedule on time and having them actually show up for work. On the other hand, when your business starts growing and spreading to other locations across the country or even around the globe, then things can get more complicated. Having to manage employees across different timezones could represent a major issue and may cause some headaches to team managers or schedulers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While evaluating different needs for various business, our engineers at NimbleSchedule decided to address the need of managing teams across multiple timezones and make this process much easier and intuitive for team managers in such situations. With our shift planning system, you can easily have each of your team members set a completely different timezone through his/her profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Work-Schedule-Employee-Profile.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Work-Schedule-Employee-Profile-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Planning With Different Timezone Coverage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By adding such a functionality, our engineers and developers easily solved the problem of employee scheduling and their time off managing. You can now have each of your team members view the schedule according to her or his own local timezone configuration without worrying about a possible confusion. Our shift planning system will simply convert the time for each user in the system according to the profile timezone set without any need for a manual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case your employee needs to request a time-off, he can do that without having to worry about time differences. In other words, your employees can simply input a request according to their local time and you as the manager or supervisor will see those entries in the schedule according to your own timezone set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes both for the scheduling process and for all notifications. Each shift notification, either by email or sms, will simply reflect the time of a timezone selected by an employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if your employee decides to use the smart phone app, his shift times will be simply adjusted to his phone time. If you, or your employees frequently travel across different timezones, then you certainly do not need to worry about the time difference while either looking at your personal schedule or managing your employees’ schedule. NimbleSchedule does all the heavy lifting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Shift Planning Primer</title>
   <link href="/blog/shift-planning/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-02T00:59:27-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/shift-planning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;scheduling-employeeshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201405employee-schedulingpnghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201405employee-schedulingpngemployee-scheduling-ought-to-be-that-one-truly-great-contact-every-week&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/employee-scheduling.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/employee-scheduling.png&quot; alt=&quot;scheduling employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Employee Scheduling ought to be that one truly great contact, every week.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-shift-planning-lets-you-do-it&quot;&gt;Good Shift Planning lets you do it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your one great in, every week is a chance to renew that commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every email is too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of our best clients, those who are the most pleased - like retail stores, hospitals and call centers - and even a few factories - operations are going on 24 hours a day and seven days every week. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/may-2014/statistical-bulletin.html&quot;&gt;Numbers are looking good, thank goodness&lt;/a&gt; but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping these places going means staffing them with reliable, attentive and dedicated people. The costs to organizations who don’t realize this are just ridiculous. Unfortunately for all of us, though, that “employees-last” model remains very much the Standard Operating Procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet for each of them, that scheduling email remains the one make-or-break email that they send out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/calendar-software/&quot;&gt;scheduling email is not optimized - for employee engagement, continuous improvement and talent retention - &lt;/a&gt;then you’re almost certainly losing people - and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before all of that, let’s take a look at what your shift planning really needs to include. Under-staffing and over-staffing are both problematic - and for different reasons - but at the end of the day, too many or too few people costs you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Understand Employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do a lot of work with smaller retail and call center outfits who hire students. Students working short part-time shifts - and older adults are both two very different markets. They can work together too. In fact, lots of happy older adults wouldn’t have it any other way. Knowing their preferences also means knowing something about their lifestyles too. Adults with younger kids can be your very best employees but they have very different needs from younger people with no kids. Retirement age seniors can also be very profitably employed but their no good to you if you aren’t ready to listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2) Understand Shifts
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to estimate staffing requirements across shifts and at all varying hours. Seasons, months, weeks - all of them bring different demands. The people you need will change, too. Knowing peak hours and external factors that can affect them is just plain crucial for the scheduling manager. Likewise, communicating knowledge of that demand is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Clarify Employee Classifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing about dividing employees into groups or scales is really that you let them know. It doesn’t mean creating strict divisions but usually you’re dividing by “skill set” and experience. That might be followed by a consideration of seniority. But the important thing here is that this be relatively public information. We say “relatively” because you don’t need to post it for all employees to see. But every employee deserves a brief explanation of how decisions are made and why. Employees should also be able to understand exactly how they can supplement their skill sets to get better access to different shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Plan for Holidays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another area where a clear policy is your best friend. A month’s notice for vacations is standard, but also, make sure that employees understand why or why not. Holiday seasons can create a demand for staff, or they can deaden everything. Plan yours aapropritately&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Public posting of Employee Schedules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, NimbleSchedule schedules are on the internet. They can always be read by anyone that you grant permission to view them. But keep in mind how much of the schedule each employee needs to see. In general you want them to see more - rather than less - of a given schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Work towards ever more Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Badly implemented Flex-Time plans can cost more than their worth. But once you’re getting used to whatever system you’re using, practice rolling out more and different policies. A well designed Flex-Time plan should allow employees to voluntarily prevent you from any over-staffing or under-staffing - EVER AGAIN. Work towards making whatever kind of schedule you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But short of actual Flex-time, allowing for greater employee flexibility in making their own schedules is still always a good thing for employees. Make it good for you too. The point to shift planning is really to enunciate rules about supply and demand, to anticipate when you’ll need more or fewer people, and then to establish ways for your employees to meet those needs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Posting Announcements</title>
   <link href="/blog/posting-announcements/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-29T10:46:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/posting-announcements</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping your employees or co-workers well informed and updated about any company’s changes is a must in the business world. Therefore, having a right workforce announcements tool could be your major advantage, especially when organizing big events or when dealing with projects on a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that specific purpose, our engineers and developers designed more than one way for employee communication. One of those means of communication are instant employee notifications that you can easily post through NimbleSchedule and have your team notified instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you login to the system, in the bottom right corner you should be able to see the “Post Announcement” label. When you click on it, a small popup window will show allowing you to post an announcement and select a couple of useful options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Post-Announcement.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Post-Announcement-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Workforce Announcements&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the first things you’ll notice on this popup window is an option to select the recipients of your announcement. As an administrator, you’ll have an option to post an announcement to everyone, or perhaps restrict it just to a specific location or have it sent just to your managers. These options allow you to filter out specific groups of employees that need to be notified about some important news you have to share with them. In case you select the “locations” option, then you’ll get a list of all your locations so you can select one or multiple locations to post an announcement to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you’ll have a chance to define an expiration date of your announcement. Having a message sticking out for all your team members is definitely important, but having too many messages posted around could be a bit confusing. Hence, our system allows you to specify an expiration date by which your announcement will be automatically removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you set those initial options, the only thing left is to fill in the message subject and the body of your message. The same thing you would do with an email message, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you submit this announcement, depending on your employee and manager notification preferences, they may receive such a notification via email as well, or maybe even via SMS. Of course, if they haven’t enabled any of those two options, they will be able to see your announcement as the first thing upon logging to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This employee communication tool improves team communication and empowers administrators and managers to easily broadcast work related messages to their employees and team members in a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>4 Questions for Managers to Improve Employee Retention</title>

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-retention-comes-down&quot;&gt;Employee Retention Comes Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-what-your-managers-say-to-their-people&quot;&gt;to What Your Managers Say to their People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depressed companies lose money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they also lose employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the knowledge, experience, and skill of your management, they need to be able to speak and speak well with everyone on your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like depressed people, depressed companies don’t have that conversation going. That conversation is continually engaging, caring, involved and interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four questions are intended to start that conversation and to keep it going. Your managers need to be not only skilled at asking them, but also interested in the responses. They need to want to hear the answers, to consider them carefully and be able to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as this; You can’t expect employees to be engaged with a company (or a boss) who doesn’t listen, doesn’t care, doesn’t engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So asking - and then listening - is the number one factor for improving engagement and improving employee retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-need&quot;&gt;1. What do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else can I get you? What would make you feel like you’re able to do better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer doesn’t have to be expensive, or to require a further investment. Some office managers are ready with the Viking Catalog, but office supplies aren’t really the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-do-you-want-to-go&quot;&gt;2. Where do you want to go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today? This week? In your career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you may not need to ask this question every day. But with every employee or team member, the question(s) need to be asked - and replied to regularly. Even if you’re listening to what sound like wild dreams, taking the answers seriously and seriously doing what you can to get employees to where they want to go is ALWAYS in your organization’s best interest. Those employees already are better engaged, and less likely to walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-make-you-proud-enough-to-tell-people-where-you-work&quot;&gt;3. What would make you proud enough to tell people where you work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one often takes employees a little longer to answer. Sending the question by email and waiting for a response later is often a good policy. You can expect employees to put some careful thought into answering. You can also expect to learn a lot. So, send an email then speak thoughtfully with each team member in a conference. Write down their answers so they know you’re listening. Good management presents the results of this kind of survey on up the ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also modify this question to address broader - or more narrow - areas of concern. “What would make your proud of this department?” and etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-could-change-something-today-what-would-it-be&quot;&gt;4. If you could change something today, what would it be?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, lastly, lots and lots of team members don’t want to critique management. The risk for them is simply too great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That could be OK. But if things are really out of line, then you’re going into a depression state where employees are thinking but unable to act on those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is an information boon for management, and for Continuous Improvement. You may not get an answer every time you ask, but when you do, be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe obviously, we concentrate in this kind of article on industries that really do suffer from employee retention issues. Namely, call centers and nursing facilities (of every kind). But these kinds of issues plague far more industries than that. In fact, that’s why we’re not mentioning any more specifics - there are simply too many types of businesses plagued by Human Resources based issues that can - and should - be asking and answering these kinds of questions - regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember - if you’re sending out regular email, like your weekly scheduling emails, there’s no better time to be asking questions. Just make sure you are working with management to prepare to answer thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stop Employeer Turnover by Healing the Toxic Company Culture</title>
   <link href="/blog/stop-employee-turnover/"/>

&lt;p&gt;Company culture is alive and well as a topic of how to stop employee turnover and convert your lackluster slackers into an engaged and determined, productive workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233751&quot;&gt;Mission, Brand and Culture really do need to converge. &lt;/a&gt;We’ve written in these pages quite a lot about all of the above. Getting your mission statement to match up with the mission of each and every one of your people, and getting those same people to actually advocate for your brand are two very important ways to get going. But it all comes to naught if your company’s culture is working against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are 7 things that new recruits are going to scrutinize. Plus what you can do to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Everything is Perfect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic, working culture is one that is working. Old problems are being addressed and - guess what - new problems are ALWAYS being created. Talk straight about what’s being addressed and how. Transparency is the hallmark of any effective culture, and so, just about everyone throughout your company should understand what’s being changed and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Success is just sort of rewarded.&lt;/strong&gt;
Expected? Ignored? How exactly is your company celebrating and recognizing success? Just sort of, whatever? Bad move. Spell it out and put controls in place so that nobody has an ambiguous position toward success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. This position was created out of thin air.&lt;/strong&gt;
What just happened? Someone else walked out because your culture is toxic? Pay close attention to what just happened and keep people talking. The undercurrent of mistrust in the wake of any dismissal or resignation can be devastating.  Interview the supervising manager and understand why people leave their jobs. Interview team members too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**4. Everyone here is new, but the company is not. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely that’s a sign that some very negative, destructive and impacted “somebody somewhere” is preventing necessary changes. They’re polluting the culture, like Britney Spears at Carnegie Hall, and whether they’re related to the boss or not, they’ve got to go.  This can be a tough nut to crack, and you may need to look, deeply, into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2014/01/20/6-strategies-to-hanhandldling-a-bad-boss/&quot;&gt;working well with a less than stellar boss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. People just get promoted, no rhyme, no reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can sound like #2 above, but it also goes to a general ambiguity over rules, regulations, and operating procedures. It’s a disaster for culture in that all kinds of resentments and toxins breed in the shadows and wrinkles of bad policies. Clarify things, write’em down and make sure everyone is on the same page going forward. There is really no easy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The Wrong People Get Fired.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, some of the people most annoying to a sick culture are the people trying to make it better. Listen to the voices that are shouting out solutions. Many of them are there. If you don’t hear them, ask for them. There may be a din at first, but let your employees fix your culture and you’ll probably improve your entire operation - over night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Good Ideas Go Nowhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we’re most proud of with NimbleSchedule is that the simplest improvement to communications has such a tremendous affect on broader operations. Sending people an automated “good idea” email along with the latest schedule of when they’re to show up is just the first step to reaping good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of culture comes down, quite simply, to improving communications. The repercussions are endless. To stop employee turnover and really improve culture, you may need to make some hard decisions. Stop destructive, backward thinking is a pleasure. Except when they’re on the top of the heap. Bad bosses, managers and executives can be a drain on everything your organization sets out to do. But at the end of the day, they’re losing you a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>The cloud employee schedule calendar</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-schedule-calendar/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-17T01:06:10-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-schedule-calendar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;business-cloud-computinghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201212cloud-business-computing-e1403930305607jpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201212cloud-business-computing-e1403930305607jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cloud-business-computing-e1403930305607.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/cloud-business-computing-e1403930305607.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;business cloud computing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;launching-your-employee-schedule-calendar-into-the-cloud-is-a-breath-of-fresh-air---for-you-and-your-work-team&quot;&gt;Launching your employee schedule calendar into the cloud is a breath of fresh air - for you and your work team!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your employee schedule calendar is just like every part of your business software and computer infrastructure. Slowly but surely, more and more of it is lifting off from local hard drives and servers and settling up in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved security measures, contractual guarantees and access that simply couldn’t be delivered locally make it all the more likely that an increasing part of your data will settle in the cloud too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As businesses struggle with changing needs, technologies and workforces, all of them face an increasing pressure to adapt to the new business environment. But it’s not something you need to dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, you may find that your business can adapt quickly and profit mightily from a few simple cloud-based innovations coming down the pike…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-cloud-hosted-employee-calendar&quot;&gt;The Cloud Hosted Employee Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt;’s cloud employee schedule calendar is designed to make scheduling even highly complex work schedules and shift schedules easy. But ease of use is just the beginning of the benefits you’ll enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule allows for far greater flexibility in all of your employee scheduling.&lt;/strong&gt; So much so that shift schedulers and managers don’t need to monitor individual employee shifts. Instead, they set initial rules and can allow for far greater voluntary shift scheduling. Suddenly every shift and position is covered, while employees schedule time on or off the clock in a way that’s more comfortable for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happier employees feel they’re gaining increasing respect from a company that’s easily able to accommodate their personal lives and balance everyone’s complex scheduling needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; requires no roll-out, and integrates easily with standing systems, your managers are up and running in just a day or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You end up with a much happier workforce, even though you’re spending far less time micromanaging individual employees’ schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it’s in the cloud, employees check in from where ever they happen to be. So it’s the perfect solution for remote workforces and for business with multiple overlapping shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers can be alerted to problems or to conflicts only when they come up and can set increasingly complex rules - only as they need to. Minimum and maximum work weeks goals are easily met without the necessity for expensive over-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-cloud-is-nothing-but-silver-lining&quot;&gt;This Cloud is Nothing but Silver Lining.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your new cloud based employee scheduling calendar lets every employee check in remotely, by smart phone, text or email. &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; even integrates easily with Google Calendar or even Facebook events calendar. Employees get the advantage of increased flexibility, and you get anytime, anywhere access to the data that keeps your employees in the best shape for your business. Alerts go out - only to those who need them - and under-staffing of any given shift can easily reach workers who are much more enthusiastic about showing up, or covering a last-minute dropped shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; is probably not the first cloud-based service your company will take advantage of. Almost certainly it won’t be the last. One more big advantage you’ll experience is that &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; regularly provides system updates, database tuning, backups, reporting functionality and service improvements that keep your manager focused on the task at hand rather than on software difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to complex paper-based scheduling and bulletin board postings. No matter the size or scale of your current enterprise, &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to scale with your business. As your better able to determine which team members are helping your business to grow, your also better able to grow as a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s something to make all of us smile, even on the very cloudiest of days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Call Center Job Description</title>
   <link href="/blog/call-center-job-description/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-12T08:01:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/call-center-job-description</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;job-description-call-centerhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201405call-center-job-descriptionpnghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201405call-center-job-descriptionpngrevising-your-call-center-job-description-tells-call-center-employees-where-theyre-going&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Call-Center-Job-Description.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Call-Center-Job-Description.png&quot; alt=&quot;job description call center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Revising your Call Center Job Description Tells Call Center Employees Where They’re Going.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a thorough understanding of the big picture call center business. Few managers know that actually communicating that understanding is also the best way to hold onto employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long gone are the days of the dead-end, “slacker-heaven” call center job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s call center manager needs to be providing expertise, not only to callers, but to the workers taking the calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the call center industry develops and changes, so too does the job description that keeps your positions filled. These are just some of the points you should be making in your job description to find - and keep - the right people. They know, perhaps better than you, that these are the skills that will keep them advancing over a career that lasts a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the following is also a path that opens up for your representatives. So even for low-skill workers, the more they are learning, the more likely they are to extend their now profitable relationship with your firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;help-desk--tech-support&quot;&gt;1) Help Desk &amp;amp; Tech Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was perhaps the original life-line dropped into the “going nowhere” despair of the call center worker. Even if they’re just helping visitors to navigate your “otherwise perfect” website, experience with technical support and help desk is important. Play it up. No matter how distant your company is from actually developing apps, online products or services, accessing the information and providing assistance is an important part of any center service. Assembly, use, warranty registration, and all kinds of related customer service make yours a Help Desk and the service your operators offer into a Tech Support role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brand-advocacy&quot;&gt;2) Brand Advocacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve written in the past about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-advocates/&quot;&gt;employee advocates&lt;/a&gt;, and converting listless disengaged employees into advocates who happily promote your brand. You can only expect people to really advocate for your brand if they truly love where they work. For that, you better be providing them with an incentive beyond salary for doing this grueling and difficult work. Start with making call center workers love where they work. Then make them love who they’re representing. Then strategize ways to make the message real and the point will sink home. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toprankblog.com/2013/01/engaged-employees-brand-advocates/&quot;&gt;five more tips for doing just that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ultimate-support&quot;&gt;3) The Ultimate Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support staff have gotten the short end of the stick. In the change from secretaries to “admin assists” somehow the word “support” has gotten a raw deal. It’s an important role whether you’re ops are investigating billing statement charges, the finer points of policy or new interest charges. Any number of these support roles could prepare your op for a future in administration. Funny enough, that’s exactly where a proven phone manner is often a most valuable asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;collections-savvy-is-sales-savvy-too&quot;&gt;4) Collections Savvy is Sales Savvy, too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the toughest jobs on the phone are also some of the most rewarding. Yes, people walk away all the time. Preparing people to walk away is, funny enough, one of the best ways to keep them from actually walking. Even if your managing a call center as a third party collections agency, your people are sales people. Nothing prepares phone ops and agents for a career in sales like tough-nosed collections calling. The techniques are the same. The atmosphere can be brutal if you’re not careful and the rewards are next to none. That means, management needs to be on top of doling out the rewards.  Collections pros are natural sales people and your organization would be wise to consider them as such - and not as disposable human fodder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications-everything&quot;&gt;5) Communications Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at revising your company FAQ with the call-center front and center in your research. They’re experts in wording, explanations and the finer points of what, how and why. If they need to explain away some troubling truth, ask them how they do it. Call centers do get called “Nerve Centers” at times, but thinking of them as intelligent “Brain Centers” is often the truth too. Continuous improvement, innovation on steroids, and employee engagement are all possible when you let your ops do some talking, and you do some listening. The true communicators, those gifted enough to accurately record (write) what they experience, have a future in communications, marketing, or even strategy and planning. Tell them and help them to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reputation-management&quot;&gt;6) Reputation Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it the other way, from number two above. Some firms (perhaps yours?) have work cut out for them just to keep off of customers’ hit list. They’re their own worst enemies and having friendly, knowledgeable and competent voices on the phone is a huge plus. Otherwise they’d drive into the ditch and stay there. Reputation management starts with the very next interaction. Even the ignored interactions - like countless call center calls - make a fast and important impact. You better believe, too, that phone conversations get noted on the internet (where Reputation Management matters most). Your ops who make big improvements in parent company reputation. Make sure employees are reminded that this is an important growth area for all kinds of communications areas and all kinds of companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these points are, in fact, growth areas. Call center employees don’t like feeling stuck and going nowhere. Giving them a future is a very important way of keeping a bit more of their future intertwined with yours. All the other things you do with them are more profitable when they’re more profitable for your employees too. You don’t need expensive raises and bonuses if you’re working with real promises - and real understanding. Are your managers?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Flextime Plans: 5 Good Reasons Every Employer Needs One</title>
   <link href="/blog/flextime-plans/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-05T00:02:25-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flextime-plans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/flextime-plans.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/flextime-plans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flextime planning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solid-reasoning-for-flextime-plans&quot;&gt;Solid Reasoning for Flextime Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes business management is all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrzone.com/hr-glossary/employee-engagement-definition&quot;&gt;Employee engagement is everywhere.&lt;/a&gt; And so is team building, leadership and various schemes to leverage values, mission statements and creative, continuous improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all makes sense. It all makes perfect sense to someone who realizes that employees want to be treated like, uh, people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But business is also tough. Employees, workers, team players - even ducks if you happen to employ them - need to put in solid hours. Often they need to put in a LOT OF HOURS to get everything done that needs getting done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being human, living like people, just managing the day-to-day stuff can be a real hassle when you’re chained to a desk. And that’s why flextime is such an important part of having, holding and keeping the best people in your field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any call-center manager will tell you, they regularly watch their best people walking out the door. The walking of skilled workers &lt;a href=&quot;http://claritybusiness.ca/employee-turnover-and-the-real-costs/&quot;&gt;costs US businesses an estimated 150% of their total remuneration package. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even a simply flextime plan cuts way into that cost. It keeps your people happy. It let’s them go to the doctor, or the gym or to their other business interests and makes everyone in your organization happy. But that’s just the first and most obvious of our five reasons to set up and implement your plan. Let’s look at the others in some detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;**Work Life Balance – **Anyone with kids should be able to understand this one, almost too easily. Your employees just don’t have time to look after their kids or their parents or their families. There was never a time when a factory policy for in and out time was a good idea. At no point in the past was it ever a working behavioral model. So get rid of the old model and see how your team responds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work-Load Sharing&lt;/strong&gt; – Not just for your employees, but your entire organization works smarter by splitting big, tedious or demanding jobs up among more than one person. You prevent burn-out, force collaboration and avoid over-dependence on one person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Engagement Rates –&lt;/strong&gt; Of course we still think about engagement. But you can’t really expect employees whose lives are coming apart at the seams to engage with what you’ve got on offer. More work, the same dull hours and the need to schedule a half hour off up to a week in advance. That’s more like a recipe for turnovers than a ticket to success. Employees with well-managed flextime alternatives not only think twice about quitting, but often deeply appreciate the unique opportunity an employer provides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Coordination –&lt;/strong&gt; Alternate schedules insist on employee self-coordination - just like the scheduling itself. When teams are collaborating on hours, they’re collaborating on everything else they’re working on, too. Again, that can lead to a smarter organization and a decentralized decision making process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smarter Workweeks –&lt;/strong&gt; That newly free Friday - or whatever day - can mean management or team leaders get better time for revision, review and planning. If teams are delivering as a result of ten hour days, or compressed work schedules maybe they’re enjoying an extra day off. But your real superstars are also enjoying the benefits of working with that compressed schedule - instead of responding to artificially imposed workday stoppages or interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve worked with roll out and using all kinds of Flextime plans. With temporary crews, telecommuters and project specific employees. Every possible model has some advantages and can lead to implementation problems. But working with the right plan nearly always has benefits that far outstrip the disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you implemented a flextime plan with your employees? Let us know your experience in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently added the option to set your own display name for email notifications. For example instead of the standard display name of “Schedule Support”, you can now configure your account so that emails display under “My Company Schedule”. To update this, click on “My Account” at the top of the main page and select “Company Information”. From here, you can then enter your own email display name.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>6 Essentials for Spotting High Performance during Recruitment</title>
   <link href="/blog/spotting-high-performance/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-28T00:53:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/spotting-high-performance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/spotting-top-performance.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/spotting-top-performance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;spotting top performance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spotting high performance potential in new recruits is one of the big challenges facing any recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We right here a lot about teamwork, leadership and using technology and good common sense to streamline, optimize and tweak out any organization. That’s what “nimble” means after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spotting-high-performance-matters&quot;&gt;Spotting High Performance Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the recruitment process is different. Short of divination, you’ve got to have a solid method, down, for knowing what to look for.  These are some of the top tips we’ve garnered from the Human Resources pros we’re working with every day. In part, we’ve used them to make sure that NimbleSchedule is only hiring and working with the very top performers in each of their respective fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Hire Weird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the real stand-out in our list. Top performers are different. They’re people and they have  only their own relationship with the world. It’s the conformists and the normal people who want to hide. Top performers stand out and it may not always be for what you expect. Check their skills, but more importantly, be open to who (and what) came in the door.  It may be a top performer who can’t quite handle the fashion standards or the social norms. Get used to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Hire Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top Performers know where they want to go. Short-term goals are telling, and they should be stated, focused and clear. Long-term goals should be big, even outlandish, but stated with confidence and certainty. Doubts when it comes to goals are OK, but there should be a readily apparent eagerness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Check the Paper Trail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotting Top Performance means checking the clues they leave. Top of their High School Class is always a good thing. What they’ve done since then is OK, but is it really just a bunch of bluster? Your star team player is going to have some history of success, but the real world is a tough place. Look for academic success and depending on their level and years of experience, some outstanding successes. There’s always something in there, and the weird, goal-oriented shining stars are always happy to brag on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Critical Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your star player get into trouble later. During the recruitment process, you do want an ambitious, critical and analytical understanding of the entire environment. That doesn’t mean negativity. But a star performer can talk frankly about what went wrong in the past and what could have been done differently to achieve better results. Ambitious people tend to be perfectionists and gaining the upper hand often means learning to work, critically, with established norms and standards, and improving them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5. Look for the Ridiculously Busy **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good time management is crucial, and, truth be told, it’s the only way to be a high performer. In some cases, you’ll be asking people to drop projects to come on board. In other cases, you’ll want people who maintain a lot of outside work just the same. Both situations are good signs that you’re talking to someone who is working at the top of their game, and doing it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Understand Attitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of good hypothetical situations is good. But this is your basic one: “There is never a finish to ‘work,’ what do you do?” Star performers work for the work, it’s not only what they like, but what they live for. An end to work would be not only catastrophic, but it sometimes is. Notice how quickly and well they can think of a reasonable and productive solution to each of your hypotheticals and keep in mind that some true weird stars will really be thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear your tips below for locating and pinpointing the best and the brightest. Please let us know your very best couple of recruitment tips in the comments space below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rules for Great PR</title>
   <link href="/blog/rules-for-great-pr/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-25T10:30:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/rules-for-great-pr</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting that hardly needed attention from various media is a goal everyone in business is trying to achieve, especially those that just started doing their business. Unless you had a groundbreaking idea with investors already waiting in the line to fund your business, then chances are pretty high that you have a quite limited budget for marketing and PR. With that idea in mind, we decided to write this article covering some guidelines you can follow to ensure you maximize your public relations strategy with limited funds you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PR-Strategy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PR-Strategy-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Public Relations Strategy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to develop the most effective PR strategy, you need to know your market audience first. Who are those potential clients that would be interested in your product or service? What are their habits and what kind of media do they follow? And, if possible, what is the exact TV or radio station, website, magazine or any other media stream &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/profiling-your-customers/&quot;&gt;your targeted audience&lt;/a&gt; follows? Once you have these facts in front of yourself, with any additional info you could gather about your potential audience, you are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important piece of information you must have prior to approaching any website owner or editor, newspaper reporter or TV/radio host is the difference between your product and all your competitors. What are those things that make your business unique when compared to others in your niche industry? Why should someone choose your product or service over your competitors? Once you have those values and features written down and highlighted, then you can consider yourself well prepared for any type of questions in order to present your business in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, having a clearly defined list of benefits your clients would get by purchasing your service or your product is a good thing to have. Once you interact with your targeted media, they will definitely want to hear about those values and what kind of info would best represent your business. Having such information ready to be used is a plus for any future communication with any kind of media representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/get-great-reviews-for-your-small-business/&quot;&gt;real client testimonials&lt;/a&gt; to prove the value of your product to a wider audience. Keep in mind that people are generally a bit skeptical toward any business they haven’t dealt with before and may need some re-assurance that they are making the right choice when selecting your product. Make those testimonials easily visible on your website or in your actual store, and what’s even more important, try to include such testimonials whenever possible in your interaction with media representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are well prepared with all this info, you are ready to approach the targeted media representatives with a story about your service or product. By now, you know who your audience is, what kind of media is the most attractive for them (e.g. some specific website, magazine, newspapers, TV station, etc). What you have to remember is not to be pushy. Make contact and wait for them to return a call, email, or use any other communication tool that you used to reach out (e.g. social media communication, the website contact form submission, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When communicating with media representatives, make sure to ask for permission to follow-up. With such permission in mind, which you hopefully won’t abuse by contacting them too often, try to have a couple of meaningful phone calls or write a few emails to ensure they have all the relevant information they need in order to publish an article or blog post about your business and whether or not they intend to do that. By following up you will ensure that everything is still on the right path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever available, try to use any kind of visuals. If you are trying to reach out to a newspaper reporter or a website owner/editor, try to include some appealing photo of your product. Keep in mind that general audience likes to see something visual along the line of the text presented whereas media representatives like to see what they are actually writing and telling people about. In case you are communicating with a TV station or a video blog owner, try to include some video material, if possible. Whatever material you decide to include, make it look good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these rules guarantees success in your PR strategy. However, following these basic rules increases the chance of getting some positive PR exposure for your startup business. Depending on the level of your success, make sure to re-assess on a recurring basis, re-adjust, if needed, and keep powering through.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Toward Better Management of Telecommuters: 9 Tips for Success</title>
   <link href="/blog/management-of-telecommuters/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-22T00:53:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/management-of-telecommuters</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;telecommuter-managementhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201404screen-shot-2014-04-16-at-41110-pmpnghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201404screen-shot-2014-04-16-at-41110-pmpng&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-16-at-4.11.10-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-16-at-4.11.10-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Telecommuter Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloud-based-workers&quot;&gt;Cloud Based Workers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-reinventing-your-job-for-you&quot;&gt;are Reinventing Your Job for You!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/19/marissa-mayer-telecommuting/&quot;&gt;Melissa Mayer burst the telecommuting world’s dream bubble at Yahoo! just over a year ago, &lt;/a&gt;the issue of whether to telecommute - or not -  has remained something of a misnomer in the Human Resources industry. Telecommuting is definitely not the answer to everything. Then again, Mayer’s reining in of Yahoo! probably said more about Yahoo! than it did about the general nature of America’s workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Surprise: The Management of Telecommuters is as new as telecommuting itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also an exciting and growing part of human resources. Internal and external people, in many industries, collaborate on all kinds of projects. Project-specific workers - with project-specific skills - often join up just for the length of a project. They add all kinds of value, expertise and know-how that might never be available from a full time employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project-based workers are often some of the most in-demand, highly educated and highly skilled of any workers. Working with them can often require meeting lots of demands for flexibility, openness and innovative thinking. Working like an old-school factory is probably not going to keep many of them around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning your best people into these kinds of demanding, highly educated and highly skilled workers&lt;/strong&gt; is going to require the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/change-workplace-culture/&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; that telecommuting, like flex-time, will likely work best as a reward for your better employees. Employees who perform better and who pull their weight and who lead other employees or entire teams deserve more freedom. They also deserve the recognition that truly outstanding service can warrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agility-is-everything&quot;&gt;Agility is everything.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Broker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working toward making a your HR department or organization into a talent brokerage can not be overemphasized. That’s really what this article is about. Whether you’re working with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/scheduling-software-for-temporary-staffing/&quot;&gt;outsourcing agency&lt;/a&gt;, hiring freelancers or moving more and more of your people to the cloud, becoming the talent brokerage for your organization is what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2. Collect the right data. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule can help in myriad ways but your new talent brokerage is going to be collecting and analyzing data on hours, productivity, and performance. You’ll be matching that with career aspirations, skill sets, performance histories and more. But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let’s make sure you know what you’ve gotten yourself into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Work Toward Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That always comes up, doesn’t it? You’re going to need to be strategic about rewarding key players with telecommuting privileges. And rewarding others with freelancers and cloud based help. Make sure everyone can have a hand in understanding how these decisions are made and why. Where possible, you want to localize the decision making to the people who will benefit from your telecommuting teams and players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make your policy clear and public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If resentments and misunderstandings are going to hamper productivity (and they will) there’s almost no point in going ahead with a telecommuting option. Make clear what behaviors and productivity levels will be rewarded and who will benefit and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Understand the Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online contractor exchange sites can be a significant plus for even big, resource rich organizations. Learn how to use them. But remember, far away and truly talented freelancers will demand just as much respect, patience and care as in-house employees. The form of that “respect, patience and care” may be significantly different and the advantage to your company may not be strictly in the form of cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Integrate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying on from #5 above, “understanding the cloud” may very well mean better integrating communications and technology - literally in the cloud - so that offsite players are always seeing and working with the same interface as people on-site. Your talent brokerage play a major role in streamlining, maintaining and facilitating that network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Collaborate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR is the key actor in integrating and developing the systems that cross all of the boundaries within the organization. That can be tough position. Collaborating, understanding and respecting the needs and the desires of all the people within those various boundaries can take some doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Manage Your Talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can sound like a nightmare, or a dream come true. E&lt;strong&gt;xperienced freelance talent, as well as your old-hand telecommuting staff, need to come in sometimes.&lt;/strong&gt; Purely social gatherings or meet-and-greets can work wonders, but so too can trainings, orientations and pure information exchanges. A workforce strategy that utilizes project-based workers can give companies access to highly skilled talent. Companies can be agile and responsive to changing marketplace needs—provided that they can effectively adapt their traditional talent management practices, sourcing strategies, knowledge-sharing tools and community-building activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Human is the first word in Human Resources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s striking how many old-school “Fordist” human resources managers can’t handle that. They’re some of the worst at learning the management of telecommuters. The talent brokerage idea goes right over their heads. And as we’ve heard (herd?) before, a lot of this sounds a lot easier said than done - especially in bigger, nastier organizations with impacted management styles and flagging bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/hr-generalist/&quot;&gt;Human Resources Generalists&lt;/a&gt; are working from the cloud. Contract one, learn how they’re doing what they’re doing and how they can help you to do more, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Scheduling Software for Temporary Staffing: 7 Essential Tips to Keep You Going</title>
   <link href="/blog/scheduling-software-for-temporary-staffing/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-14T00:27:11-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/scheduling-software-for-temporary-staffing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Scheduling-Software-for-Temporary-Staffing.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Scheduling-Software-for-Temporary-Staffing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Temporary staffing software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;temporary-staffing-and-scheduling-software&quot;&gt;Temporary Staffing and Scheduling Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling software for temporary staffing sort of makes you wonder how staffing agencies ever got along without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few big temporary staffing agencies, in fact, make up some of NimbleSchedule’s happiest customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this article is actually for the organization that has brought on an agency to fill temporary or short term staffing needs. It may very well be that: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/strategic-workforce-planning/staffing.aspx&quot;&gt;Companies consistently use contingent workers to deal with ups and downs,&lt;/a&gt;” but that doesn’t necessarily mean everyone is an expert in dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any human resources manager knows that working with temporary staffing agencies can open a whole different, and very complicated, can of worms. Workers themselves can misunderstand who the employer is and far too often, supervisors and managers can also misread or misdirect temporary employees. Avoiding  “co-employer” status can take some effort and some know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep these six tips in mind for scheduling and working with temporary staffing agencies and their people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reputable-temp-agencies&quot;&gt;1. Reputable Temp Agencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick to working only with a reputable temporary staffing firm. They may not be the cheapest. But they are experts in compliance with complicated and potentially expensive labor laws no matter your regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinate-messaging&quot;&gt;2. Coordinate Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may share scheduling software (Nimbleschedule makes it easy) but you and the staffing agency need to adhere to strict delineations and responsibilities. A good staffing agency will understand the needs of both sides and walk you through any gray areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brand-agency-emails&quot;&gt;3. Brand Agency Emails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your email notifications or texts are branded, (and they should be), be sure that temporary workers are receiving messages branded by the staffing agency - even if the agency is integrating with your scheduling system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distinguish-between-bosses&quot;&gt;4. Distinguish Between Bosses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same thought extends to every other action your organization takes towards temporary or outsourced help. If you feel that your staffing agency is not doing enough to distinguish their employees, and to prevent “second-class status”, you are at liberty to discuss it with them. Many staffing agencies are very protective of their star performers (hence the high fees to hire them outright) and will work with you to keep communications and direction clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-it-in-writing&quot;&gt;5. Get it in Writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document everything. A written contract is essential. Delineate the employment relationship, the responsibilities being covered and responsibility for unemployment taxes, Medicare contributions and for the entirety of regulatory compliance. The Fair Labor Standards Act, which normally governs overtime payments, also needs to be discussed and understood. Again, reputable temporary staffing agencies will be more than happy to discuss and inform you on all the relevant details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-agency-sets-the-hours&quot;&gt;6. The Agency Sets the Hours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your agency places a supervisor onsite (your site) work with the supervisor to be sure that the staffing agency remains in control of the employment relationship. The agency needs to set hours of work and this is where your software may very well come into play (or into conflict). Even if you’re dictating hours, the agency should be informing workers. Training, pay, discipline and facilities use are all up to your staffing agency, but they may need very clear instruction from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;play-fair&quot;&gt;7. Play Fair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;Anti-discrimination laws still apply. Race, gender, religion and any other protected classification bear no weight in your decisions as to anything going on in the workplace. Check that any employees getting over-time pay are actually receiving it and that your written contract accurately describes the agreement you’ve come to as regards overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, because NimbleSchedule is designed even for the truly demanding scheduling needs of temporary staffing agencies, we’re also good with everyone else. If you want to discuss your own specific needs, give us a call. Or leave a comment or tip in the space below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Shift Publishing Feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/shift-publishing/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-09T06:27:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/shift-publishing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to make it easier to publish shifts, we have released a new feature that allows you to publish individual shifts. This new update also includes new visual cues for published and unpublished shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you will notice is that the shift dialog now has a “publish” button. This allows you to publish just the individual shift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-8.39.47-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-8.39.47-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;New shift dialog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, published and un-published shifts now show a different background. Published shifts show up with a solid colored background while un-published shifts will show a lined background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-8.49.46-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-8.49.46-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Published vs. Un-published shifts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that with this new update, the word “published” will no longer display below the header for each day of the week. Instead you will now see a new label showing the number of published and un-published shifts for the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-8.59.58-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2014-04-07-at-8.59.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shift counter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding this feature, you can email us at support@nimbleschedule.com, call us at 1-866-986-6462&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>4 Vital Points in Employee Development and Training</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-development-and-training/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-07T00:22:23-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-development-and-training</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-training-and-developmenthttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201404employee-development-and-trainingpnghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201404employee-development-and-trainingpngemployee-development-and-training-for-2014&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/employee-development-and-training.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/employee-development-and-training.png&quot; alt=&quot;employee training and development&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Employee Development and Training for 2014&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-vital-points-to-keep-employee-development-and-training-front-and-center&quot;&gt;Four Vital Points to Keep Employee Development and Training Front and Center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee training and development is important - and few employees ever really consider why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But those who get it - who understand the why and what and how of development and training - are your star performers.&lt;/strong&gt; They expect it, and the more your schlep it off or let it pass as secondary in importance, the more star players your organization is going to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better employees expect you to keep up your side of the deal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the vast majority of employers neither provide training, nor fully understand its importance nor its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won’t go into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eleapsoftware.com/free-training-resources/strategic-value-workplace-training.htm&quot;&gt;exactly what your training and development should look like,&lt;/a&gt; whether it’s formal training classes or ongoing articles or seminars or just meetings. Below are some of the most important considerations for bolstering, supporting and supplementing your training - or just an understanding of that training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Employee Training and Development is About Sealing Your Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every job interview includes a question about where the employee is going. “What goals do you hope to achieve?” But by and large, that’s very often the end of it.  If you don’t follow through with facilitating the reaching of those goals, then you shouldn’t be surprised when people walk out. This is a painful lesson for lots of employers to learn, and many of them will never learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be among them. But keep the following in mind too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. A Customer-Centered Organization needs to be learned.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your customers’ experience happens with employees.  Great experiences depend on well-trained and knowledgeable people. Get strategic about client and customer service. If your employees know your product and your company inside out, then find out where they want to go, and what they want to know and help them to get there. They’ll pass all of the enthusiasm back into the business - and that’s always invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Rely on Your Veterans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who’ve been there the longest have the expertise you need. Not just for promotions to management, but for understanding and teaching the skills they are relying on every day. Recognize them. Applaud them when necessary, but especially, open up a way for them to affect the skills being taught and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**4. Optimize Every Communication to Support Employee Development and Training. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve delved pretty heavily into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/calendar-software/&quot;&gt;optimizing your calendar emails&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re just one of the frequently overlooked communications emails. Much like the recent trend toward optimizing transactional emails for marketing, all of the methods you use to communicate with employees can and should be optimized to support development and training. Whether you’re adding tips and tricks, or secrets to getting a better job done, there’s a lot to be communicated. Some companies will keep the training and development formal and simply announce the next training session in their newsletter. A better strategy is to have a reporter attend the session and then to share the learning far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one more reason that the Human Resources Generalist has become such an important role within any medium or large organization. No matter what challenges your organization is facing, top-down management from the past is probably not going to solve the problem. Making your organization smarter is also, always, about it making it more efficient, more innovative and more risk averse. That sounds like a very tall order, but by holding on to the right people now, and working with them, you’ll be well on your way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Corporate Mission Statement Examples of What Not to Do</title>
   <link href="/blog/mission-statement-examples/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-31T00:49:56-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/mission-statement-examples</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Corporate Mission Statement Examples are loaded with examples of just what you shouldn’t do. Here’s how to make yours better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mission-statement-examples.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mission-statement-examples.png&quot; alt=&quot;mission statement examples&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today’s transparent business, and those struggling to get up to speed on today’s business culture, the Mission Statement is something of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not on a mission. You may be out “to make a statement” but more than likely simply making a statement will seem too risky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a statement though is one of those cases where the reward outweighs the risk. Like a lot of things we talk about here, the process earns you the reward, and it’s always the one who makes the right statement who earns the reward. Hence the cliche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really making a statement requires a certainty and a willingness to stand your ground. Doing a mission statement should be a positive step for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weknownext.com/blog/hr-s-role-in-developing-a-positive-corporate-culture&quot;&gt;HR toward developing a corporate culture&lt;/a&gt; and NOT a provocative statement of the lofty ideals of a disconnected and largely absent management - or worse - ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If owners are not involved in management, they shouldn’t be involved in the mission, culture or values either. There is nothing worse for your culture than having values or mission dictated from on high. It degrades your workforce, provokes resentment and denigrates your mission no matter what you think your mission ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. Does your staff really share the same values as upper management?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy answer is, they probably do. But simply dictating any list of values is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS a ticket to rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mission is going to be the same way. If you just get a draft from your copywriter, then you can’t expect people to be interested in it, to adhere to it or to even read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s boilerplate. Failed mission statement examples are always bad boilerplate copy that just isn’t going to cut it with today’s engaged, focused and values-loving workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, your mission statement is probably not something you can simply survey your entire workforce to compile. It’s not a bad idea though. If you have the resources (like say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;a free SurveyMonkey account&lt;/a&gt;), then surveying is not a bad idea. This article was, in fact, gestated by a NimbleSchedule customer who used their weekly schedule mailing to invite all their staff to a survey on the latest draft of the mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often, staff have a much better idea of your customers than do upper management. Your Mission Statement needs to be drafted from that perspective and to meet those needs. Are those the needs that upper management thinks about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, your mission statement needs to develop into a concise statement of your business strategy, values and the service or product you provide. If your staff are determining the vision that animates all of the above, then so much the better. Answering these three questions is essential:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question being asked is “Why do your customers buy from you?” Think psychology, not product delivered. Again, no one is better prepared to answer this question than the people doing the selling. Include them in answering this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to get philosophical or soft here to answer this question. And just like above, not every employee can answer in a way that’s going to be useful. It’s not necessarily a question of your company values, but of meeting the needs of your customers. The more information you can get about customers, the more useful you can make your mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is our customer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lots of companies, there will be multiple answers here. They sell to multiple customers or groups of customers and many of them are wildly divergent. You may be able to find common traits that many of them share, but the process of doing so can take some time. Again, talk to your people. Make sure your copywriter is interviewing, if not interrogating, and, thoroughly reviewing any surveys conducting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mission statement is NOT as valuable as the culture it contributes too. But, it is an easy way for customers and employees to evaluate who you are and what your brand and business are all about. It may and should evolve. Let it. Like everything else we write about here, involve as many of your people as possible, and anonymously is just as good. Let them have it. They will thank you for the opportunity, and they’ll be part of your mission, too. As well they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Teamwork Fails, and 9 Things You Can Do About It</title>
   <link href="/blog/teamwork/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-24T00:34:13-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/teamwork</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/teamwork.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/teamwork.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Teamwork failure and what to do about it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Energized, cooperative and fully engaged teams and team members are the key to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teamwork-matters&quot;&gt;Teamwork Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your team players are also the most important factor for smart, innovative thinking and the ideas that drive all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet your teams will go down. What you can lose with a failed team is almost too staggering to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often, frustrated managers and team leaders will walk away from teams, or dumb down their expectations permanently. That’s, unfortunately, the environment that most team members inhabit - day after day - until they walk. A full &lt;a href=&quot;http://leaderchat.org/2011/11/03/60-of-work-teams-fail%E2%80%94top-10-reasons-why/&quot;&gt;60% of work teams may very likely be failing&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All teams need leaders, and blaming individual players is just way too easy. A great team leader will take responsibility for even the weakest player on a team. Let’s have a look at what it takes to reverse the overall trend toward failed teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Everything is Way Too Slow!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big one and it saps energy and leaves half your team in the dark. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/calendar-software/&quot;&gt;whatever auto-email system your using&lt;/a&gt; to highlight progress and to shed light on every step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one really can’t be outsourced or delegated. Upper management needs to get off its duff and really support teams. It can break down to a communications problem. More likely, upper management is staffed with people who really don’t care about, much less support, the teams you’re worry about. What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) End the Bark when there’s no Bite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really do face upper management who couldn’t care less, then you need to replace management, where-ever possible, with smart, proactive team-leadership. The most important thing is to end the focus on un-winnable and pointless battles. Instead, focus on achievement and what can be done when nothing else can be done. And keep the focus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Train for the Weakest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That new team leadership needs some training.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure they’re not leaving anyone out. They’re probably already dominating people, so make sure they are not overshadowing the players most likely to fall into disengagement, despondency and despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Re-Focus and then Focus, Focus, Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus can’t be under-emphasized. Ask team-leaders what is their focus for the day, week and month. Are they asking their teams what was their own focus for the day, week and month? This is another area where communications and even some online interactivity and polling, surveying and questioning - on an ongoing basis - is never too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Confront the Biggest Problems in Pieces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving truly big problems to chance is a recipe for disaster and a teamwork killer. You’ve got a team. Get the team to work together to solve parts of the problem. Open communications, anonymous responses should be welcome, and get answers. Discussions will solve anything. Use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Confront Mistrust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of trust between teams is a big, fat reason for teamwork breakdown and failure. Get it straight. Some people will hate each other. They can still learn to trust one another. Work environments are not the places for BFFs either. Keep the focus on the job to be done. By the way, even casual camaraderie can work against your team. And all of the problems above can be confronted with “focus” (see #5 above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 90% of organized meetings waste people’s time.** They also distract from focus, reinforce false and destructive hierarchies, and more often than not, they dissolve discipline. If you’re regularly herding more than 2 people into conference rooms, you’re asking for disaster and teamwork breakdown. Oh, and you’re probably making somebody feel overly important. Is it you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings require more planning and execution than 90% of meeting planners will give them, and work groups of three or four people work better without meetings. Give them space to talk. If they need more space, give them that too. But eliminate meetings and everyone will thank you. Better still, get everyone online for ongoing casual communication and you’re really in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) Energize people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher the level of management the greater the level of energy you can receive. People like receiving praise, and the higher you are the more you can give. Make sure that all your teams are giving energy and not just using it up. Keep the suggestions in check for a while and focus on the positive achievements instead of constantly criticizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember too:&lt;/strong&gt; Your team leaders are not likely reading articles like the above. Skilled employees and the kind of active, energized people you want pushing your teams along are probably involved with a hundred other things.  Each of the points above is a long, term cultural imposition that needs to be made, re-inforced, re-proposed and discussed at length, freely and openly. Take some advice to heart. You’ll leave lots of suggestions behind, even just today. But getting tranparent, dedicated, open and focused teams takes some doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But neglecting any of the above can have much more long-term consequences than you’re going to want to deal with. So let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The HR Generalist: 5 Generalizations to Live By</title>
   <link href="/blog/hr-generalist/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-17T00:51:42-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/hr-generalist</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hr-generalist.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hr-generalist.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the HR generalist at work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funny enough, one of the fastest growing specialists in the Human Resources field is no kind of specialist at all - but the HR Generalist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this list of Primary Objectives as &lt;a href=&quot;http://humanresources.about.com/od/jobdescriptions/a/HR_Generalist.htm&quot;&gt;listed on About.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development of a superior workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development of the Human Resources department.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development of an employee-oriented company culture that emphasizes quality, continuous improvement, and high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bad start for understanding the position, but as you’ll see, it also a list that’s changing quickly. Growing your HR Generalist position is not always easy, almost certainly requires stepping on some toes and pays off big when it’s done right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the five most important supplements to the list above. Like any augmentation, some parts will fit in large measure, and others need to be squeaked in, and in pieces, before the benefits start to take shape. They also require the HR Generalist to actively seek out partners in all different areas of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_
&lt;strong&gt;1) Branding the Employee-Focused Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first meeting, your brand should be evident. Exceeding expectations early means working with marketing, or your Brand Leader. Potential employees are one thing, but you’ll be surprised how many companies put their reputation right in the toilet within two weeks of EVERY NEW HIRE. Your already dedicated people can be a terrific help in understanding your brand - and in improving it. They’ve learned benefits and the process of enrolling, and the pitfalls that aren’t apparent. The HR Generalist needs to take a long look at how the brand is represented throughout this entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many HR Generalists will come from communications backgrounds. “Employee experience” has leaped to the foreground not only as organizations have become more complex and in need of better explanations. But as employees have gotten harder to hold onto, so too the process of administering the complex packages of benefits and rewards has gotten tougher. There’s good reason to have some branding background too when communications are this important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture is the key to consistent messaging, message and the messengers too. Connectedness is every bit as important and it’s culture that results. Culture also results from expectations being met, exceeded and renewed. Unifying big global organizations takes identifying and highlighting common values and common methods at least as much as throwing parties and mentioning names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency and technology should go together. The organization that is hiding something from most employees is probably going to be surprised. Employees not only know more than they should, but accordingly, they also do not, and will not trust an organization that lies to them. Employee portals and open books are not just the wave of the future, they’re really the only way to be in business today. Creaking, Addam’s Family-style businesses have an uphill battle. The HR Generalist needs to be involved in every cloud and to learn and see exactly how employees are using the cloud. Integrating the brand, the message, the culture and the values across the cloud is just one more area to get good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 5) Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HR Generalist can’t be seen as stealing employees from one area to another, but is an active participant in the growth of the organization. Personnel need to grow just like products, product lines or services and employees stuck in one position will look for growth somewhere else. That’s at a tremendous cost to any organization. In general, the HR generalist must be able to see the big picture and assist and facilitate the movement of people intra-departmentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing less than that always results in the loss of more talent and a greater cost to the organization as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Teamworks that really work: Team Building with Shift Scheduling Software!</title>
   <link href="/blog/teamworks/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-10T00:02:19-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/teamworks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/teamworks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/teamworks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;teamworks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Let’s call it Teamworks, the options you get when your setting up the auto-reply emails going out to your teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to everything else you get, the increased engagement, the positives of working with truly happy and life-balanced employees, you can also get a major team building resource. Importantly, it’s only as powerful as you make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing 3 shifts a day, chances are, your late night shift doesn’t feel any sense of team-play with the people working before and after them. That’s a big fat problem - for all your people - and for your organization as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-scheduling-software/&quot;&gt;written here&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of times, about innovative ways to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/calendar-software/&quot;&gt;use your scheduling emails to build productivity&lt;/a&gt;, and to improve overall engagement. But let’s take a look specifically at building teams, at Teamworks and making teams work better for themselves and for your overall organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t be totally specific here - NimbleSchedule is so flexible it works with all kinds of business models. But now, just imagine if the emails you’re regularly sending out were also sending out something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 1. Messages to Re-Clarify Team Purposes** - Lots of people in your organization haven’t heard what you expect from them since they got hired. What’s up with that? Review the purpose and reinforce it. Purposes change. People do too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Messages to Establish or Re-Establish Goals.&lt;/strong&gt; A little input from your people can’t hurt, but you know what’s realistic, and if you don’t why not ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Introductions, Role Clarifications and Common Purposes.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you’re in luxury goods or healthcare, there’s a common task for everyone to understand. People well-removed from the end-user need to hear about how what they do helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Close Gaps.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like above, if your own end user is not the company customer, your people benefit from knowing who the end user of their own work is. How is it benefiting them? How can it be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Work with Conflict.&lt;/strong&gt; We work with people who have to bridge teams that absolutely HATE EACH OTHER. It’s no easy task. But well-handled conflict is fuel for your fire and for learning how to make the whole thing work better. Individual goals and processes are natural places for conflicts to come up. But now that you are regularly emailing all your teams, and it’s email that’s almost guaranteed to get opened, why not use it to resolve conflicts and get people more involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Build Internal Communications.&lt;/strong&gt; No one likes to have a PowerPoint presentation read to them. Likewise, internal communications is not a dictation from some giant dead corporation. On the contrary, Communications require a dynamic two-way process, and lots and lots of people will risk nothing. That risk averse disposition hurts your company. Get on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Build Transparency.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like flex-time scheduling should be a bonus for employees who earn it, transparency is a bonus for companies who earn the trust of their teams. Continuous improvements mean you can start to build a far smarter organization. A few geniuses on top are only as good as a few hundred smart people supporting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Encourage Dissension.&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, it’s part of transparency. Anonymity, supported by any standard issue survey software, is a great way to learn from your people. You can also give even the timid a chance to say whatever they need. They might not do it other wise. Send out a survey and just see what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**9. Recognize Teams, and then People, with Reference to their Teams. **Rewards and recognition should go to teams, not to leadership. Make sure that goals and achievements are clearly articulated - even for people not on the team. And like always, time off makes the very best reward. It’s cheap. It’s very well received and it’s worth trying to achieve more of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Market Your Brand.&lt;/strong&gt; Think about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-advocates/&quot;&gt;a good social media policy can help to make your employees into Brand Advocates.&lt;/a&gt; In the same way, your regularly scheduled emails should be reminding employees of who and what they work for and who and what, together, all of you are. What you stand for really counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like we always say, auto-send emails can be a death-knoll if they’re not done properly. In fact, that’s like any other part of your company. Put the best writer on your team in charge of even the most insignificant auto-reply you send out. Communications live and die by the attention you give them. The Teamworks options for auto-scheduling and auto-confirming your teams, shifts, schedules and extra hours are just as good as you want to make them. So don’t leave them to chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know in the comments below how you’re building your internal communications and how they’re working out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Corporate values and operations strategy: Four Things to Get Today Moving.</title>
   <link href="/blog/corporate-values-and-operations-strategy/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-03T00:03:23-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/corporate-values-and-operations-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Company values and operations objectives should go together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Corporate-values-and-operations-strategy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Corporate-values-and-operations-strategy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;operations strategy and corporate values&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that corporate values and operations strategy are not thought of together, frequently, is one of the reasons that corporate values end up losing steam. It’s one of the reasons that Employee Engagement schemes bite the dust as described, quite nicely, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recognizethisblog.com/index.php/2014/02/why-employee-engagement-doesnt-work/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve written in these pages on numerous occasions on the importance of ramping up your corporate values program, developing it, pushing it and sending it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for lots of HR people, and for managers more generally, it doesn’t totally add up. Values may be what politicians talk about - but in the real world, no one thinks twice about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am writing this, I’m chatting with a friend who abhors corporations and corporate values. Her solution? She works for a music conservatory in a midwestern university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t work there because they gave her a pitch and promoted themselves as a values-centered organization. She chose to work for them because their values aligned with her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for us is that she’s desirable. She has skills, smarts and works relentlessly. She adds value to the music school and the music school doesn’t conflict with her version of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what about you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until you recognize the number of people you’re losing to these companies, non-profits and similar organizations, you’re not only going to lose employees, but customers too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s look at four things that can be done to get your values into, and active in your operations strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rewrite-them&quot;&gt;1) Rewrite Them.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal. It should be a collective undertaking, or it’s utterly meaningless. Values statements written by Public Relations departments or Marketing Teams do more harm than good and have no place in today’s workplace.  You can even &lt;a href=&quot;http://yfsmagazine.com/2013/02/01/company-culture-an-inside-look-at-100-core-values-from-15-winning-companies/#axzz2uT0vjJpa&quot;&gt;look at these 15 companies&lt;/a&gt; (not naming names) and see in a moment who needs to get on the ball and start re-writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, getting a good understanding of your values is just a matter of surveying, nominating, considering and consolidating statements. That’s no more difficult than** a survey, some analysis, another survey, some emails and some meetings**.  Just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s company wide, but that’s part of what makes it valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root out core corporate values that don’t jive with all your people, but be careful. Some of your people may not jive with your core corporate values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discuss-them&quot;&gt;2) Discuss Them.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing more unproductive than a meeting, but a few meetings are in order. These are more mandatory than any other meeting your company will organize so make them good. They’re possibly a lot more productive too. You should see in a few quick meetings who lives up to your values, who aligns with them and who doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also be prepared to explain why these values are important too. At some length. The people who resist are going to be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;build-a-values-centered-operation&quot;&gt;3) Build a Values-Centered Operation.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one everyone thinks is the tough part. It really just means you’re going to be the very best music school you can be. Ok, so you’re an insurance company, or a TV station. Be the best one possible. I don’t really get the conflict. Hospitals are easy to see as values, but let’s say you’re a call center with clients in mortgage services, an evil cable-TV operator and a shipping company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do those clients create conflicts for you? For your people? Are their values incompatible? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often, your values are an actionable value-added that softens your clients’ image(s) or that actually allows you to fill in where they cannot. All of this should be fair-game for discussion in your meetings too, by the way. Now imagine if you fired a client because their values don’t match up with your own. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;corporate-values-and-operations-strategy&quot;&gt;4) Corporate Values and Operations Strategy!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this one should be number 3 but in whatever order you do it, it means a lot if you change operations to align better with values. Every one of your people will know it. But it doesn’t need to be major departmental upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tweaking for values should not play second fiddle to bulldozing for dollars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even small tweaks to correct worker-identified conflicts can make a tremendous difference in the value added you’re able to pass on to your customers. Beyond communications and messaging, let’s look at where some other people we worked with “tweaked for values.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We helped the call center mentioned above to better align their people by committing once and for all to work-life balance. Now callers to the call center hear not just about clients, but about how they work for the leading call center in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our hospitals now remind all of their staff; security, food services and facilities managers, that they’re helping to save lives too!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We worked with a big insurance company to not only get their people into work on time but to incrementally increase their awareness of how their work contributes to the well-being and health of the company’s thousands of clients.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just the beginning. Let us know in the space below how your workplace is working to realign itself with what you all already believe.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>8 Ways your Calendar Software Should Be Blasting Everything Else Out of the Water</title>
   <link href="/blog/calendar-software/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-23T23:24:13-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/calendar-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;_&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Calendar-Software.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Calendar-Software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar Software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Calendar software is often the only auto-emailing software that an organization is using. You don’t have to be an expert in communications to see that it will do a lot more than tell people to get to work on time.  _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human resources management teams often include not just the shift scheduling department, but an internal communications department too. Pity is, they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hr/features/1014675/internal-communications-whose-job-who-shouts-loudest&quot;&gt;very often don’t understand they overlapping their duties and not working together closely enough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve installed an automated calendar software program of any kind, to alert employees to available shifts, or even just to their normally scheduled shifts, then here’s what else you should understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calendar-software-equals-internal-communications-software&quot;&gt;_Calendar Software Equals Internal Communications Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because it’s already emailing your teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a highly read email and gives you a guaranteed “in” with your audience. &lt;strong&gt;So what are you going to do with it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are eight things people who’ve automated shift-scheduling with NimbleSchedule Calendar Software are also doing with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;branding&quot;&gt;1) Branding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your people are (or should be) your biggest brand advocates. Use your weekly automated updates to reinforce values and commit to employee well-being. Branding means “what” you are, what your company is, and what it stands for. Branding is nothing less than the full personification of the organization - and that needs to be carefully considered in every message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;retention&quot;&gt;2) Retention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean anyway? For starters it means your values are not just an empty statement. They’re something behind every thing that your company does. So, your automated messaging needs to be communicating your commitment to those values and how people - all kinds of people - are living up to those values and meeting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;work-life-balance&quot;&gt;3) Work-Life Balance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the most important aspects of talent retention - and one of the reasons people get going with an automated calendar system in the first place. So send them a note about how to make the most of their time off, or news about how other team members are spending their free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognition&quot;&gt;4) Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Not the employee of the month. But the player who did the most with the least, delivered to the customer and exceeded building the company’s reputation. Every week can be a great moment to recognize someone. Every week can also be a great moment to nominate someone new for recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invite-communications&quot;&gt;5) Invite Communications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could be a bigger headache, right? Well, only if you’re really doing it wrong. A well managed operation relies on continual feedback and criticism from all of its players. It’s not a loyalty test, it’s what &lt;strong&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/strong&gt; really looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elusive-culture&quot;&gt; 6) Elusive Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t mandate a cultural change, but you can oversee a liberation, an open and transparent environment that allows you to become a smarter, and way more cost effective operation. &lt;em&gt;Stalinism&lt;/em&gt; is very, very expensive. Keeping tabs on people (something NimbleSchedule makes easy) comes at a cost, though. The cost is, you’ve got to give up a lot of the old ways of doing things and put more trust in your already smart people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extras&quot;&gt;7) Extras&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just like with the email marketing that your marketing team is hopefully trying to improve, internal communications is not ultimately about what you want, but about what your reader wants.&lt;/strong&gt; We work with a call center whose employees want to know more about the day care center next door (where the kids of the workers are all staying during the day). The internal communications team works with the day care center marketing staff to deliver news about the center, about childcare and education. You bet those emails get opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introductions&quot;&gt;8) Introductions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also work with a hospital that is simply too big for everyone to know everyone else. Now, not everybody needs to know everybody else, but you bet it helps if the heads of many of the key players in many of the different departments can occasionally show up in your email. A simple link to your internal communications blog works wonders and everyone still gets to their shift on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you doing differently with your calendar software? Innovation is the name of the game, and we’d love to hear what else can be done with the world’s most useful automated emails! Please let us know in the discussion box below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grocery Store Management: 5 Points for Shift Scheduling that Works</title>
   <link href="/blog/grocery-store-management/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-17T23:39:49-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/grocery-store-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Grocery-Store-Management.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Grocery-Store-Management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Grocery Store Management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Grocery Store Management is Changing! And keeping the best workers in place, and happy and productive has never been more important. Here’s 5 points so you can do it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good old, clunky, brick and mortar supermarkets are still playing a role they played throughout the twentieth century. Maybe now, more so than ever, they’re town centers, they’re public forums, and they’re the one place that absolutely everyone will need to show up at least once a month. All that means, as you well know, they’re still wildly important, profitable and - with thousands of products, and often hundreds of employees - difficult to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grocery store management depends on keeping your choice workers happy, getting them in there on time and managing some peak shopping times with extra workers just for those crucial hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them will stay. Some of them are finishing up. And managing who and what and where is getting easier, but surprisingly, many traditional grocery store managers will forget the most important question of all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five points are designed to let you get more “why?” into your management and your scheduling and your workers’ minds, so they’re not just sliding bar codes, but actually representing your store and your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Make it easy.&lt;/strong&gt; Switching from a bulletin board paper schedule to one that’s internet and smartphone based sounds like it’s a big change. It’s not technically demanding and most employees will vastly prefer checking hours from home - after doing it just once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Make it Obvious.&lt;/strong&gt; Print out and distribute explicit instructions so that even older, less savvy workers can do it the first time without shattered nerves. If you’re already offering voluntary shift selection give workers a little explanation about why shifts are structured the way they are. Give them more than what they want to know and, where necessary, explain the policies and restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Make it Reassuring.&lt;/strong&gt; Volatile working hours rattle nerves. Sometimes they can’t be avoided but maybe you need a reminder; workers want to do their best and to be proud of what they do. Giving workers more freedom and responsibility for their own hours and attendance always pays off and keeps people coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Make it Accurate.&lt;/strong&gt; Overtime, break times, wages and hours, clock-in, clock out - all of these need to be tracked, carefully and even religiously. That part’s gotten a lot easier with modern time tracking software, but your company has made a deal too. Keeping workers in place depends on your holding up and honoring your part of the bargain. Both sides need to be able to instantly account for any hours of any week or day or month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5) Make it Rewarding. **We often speak with employers who think that FlexTime is just an incentive. It is a big incentive. But more than that, it’s also a big money saving part of the deal. Better managing your workers’ clock-in times, total hours, and work-life balance let’s you be a much better employer. It also let’s you incentivize keeping better hours and rewards like better hours, more control, flextime and more vacation mean you actually become a magnet for the better workers in your market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with strong union participation, we’ve found that all parties are happier when workers have more control and managers have to manage less. One of the most important places to come together and agree is over all the questions that come down to why? why? why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions pays off big. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-scheduling-software/&quot;&gt;use your time management software and email features to continue to build on answering the why questions&lt;/a&gt;. Ask them. Answer them. Using your auto-emails should be integrated with your training, your continuing education and the dissemination of your message is easier and more rewarding than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is your supermarket handling today’s demanding and dynamic workforce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Corporate Responsibility: 5 Ways to Put Your Core Values to Work</title>
   <link href="/blog/corporate-responsibility/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-09T23:30:30-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/corporate-responsibility</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/musespeak/9318348436/in/photolist-fcqYkW-4a5fEF-6s7sJL-rXFk-9R6ebX-aj8NF9-4EPdaj-3KRRJW-67jzUw-5UDtCs-5Uz8J6-6dRX2h-6jFuBj-bhkW6-6nUMVg-cNUzFo-cNUz3S-9DJepn-dEivJj-5UDxKS-41dVMq-c1QYqq-4jGie5-41dWHm-5UDvEJ-3YdE8R-nuqje-kkfmL-7zsZaP-5Uz7kn-5UDv9s-58efbP-Dqvs7-8oveN2-7xMmwM-3La4Kd-9uXqF-dYsYNT-9qoPNM-eba4CY-zjHUU-8ugPZp/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Corporate-Responsibility.png&quot; alt=&quot;Corporate Respnsibility&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;_Corporate responsibility doesn’t have to be volunteer work and platitudes about neighborliness. Put real values into more of your work place and you’ll see.__&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corporate-responsibility&quot;&gt;Corporate Responsibility:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-to-put-your-core-values-to-work-already&quot;&gt;5 Ways to Put Your Core Values to Work Already!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a rage in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-values---culture---strategy&quot;&gt;Core Values - Culture - Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s enough to drive some very comfortable old dinosaurs right out of the business. The smart ones, though, are taking notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding, keeping and getting more out of the right people - the real talent in your industry - depends in some large measure on writing down, believing in and sharing the values that drive your business - if not your entire industry. For younger, smaller, leaner companies, culture and values have been like a god-send. Older, bloated, bigger, and less agile companies are - in some cases - actually driven close to bankruptcy. Think of Zappos running rings around Sears and JCPenney. They all sell the same stuff, but some of them sell a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason they can sell better is that their workforces believe in them and share the broader values of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coming-to-terms-with-corporate-responsibility&quot;&gt;Coming to Terms with Corporate Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not talking here about “social responsibility,” i.e.; what your company does in your community or city, independently of its business function. Everything being discussed below falls squarely under the rubric of “actual business function.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate responsibility, in this day and age means taking an ethical stance, promoting, living it and encouraging it in and all around your business.We’ve written here before about actually defining core values. It can seem like a daunting process to get moving - even if the outcome is broadly understood before you start.  That is to say - values don’t have to represent a big surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they do represent an important connection - the WHY - of what you’re people are doing every day and, likely, why your customers continue to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how are you going to let people know that you have this values statement that lays out your corporate responsibility to the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s give you five important and relatively easy ways to promote your core values within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start though, we’re going to omit some of the obvious places, like your About Page and your company Newsletter. These are important, but they’re also just a little obvious. Have the About Page re-written, and make an event out of the roll-out of your values. Announce that in your newsletter. Then do all of the following too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listening&quot;&gt;1) LISTENING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that the process of defining your corporate values should make your organization better at, is “listening.” &lt;strong&gt;Surveys, questionnaires and a broader culture of “listening”&lt;/strong&gt; should allow you to demonstrate (at least one of) your values, and to gather valuable information too. If you got good at surveying in developing your values, now put the same skills to use and critique management!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recruitment&quot;&gt;2) RECRUITMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate responsibility comes, in very large measure, down to a Human Resources management issue. From before the hire straight through the orientation session, you need to be checking that candidates and new hires align properly, in terms of values, with the broader culture of the organization. Work with recruiters and interviewers to discuss how your values statement shows up in the interview, hiring and orientation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, and don’t hire people who don’t share the company’s values.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;management&quot;&gt;3) MANAGEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers should be familiar with the values as they’ve been established but you might consider re-training them to insert those values into the every day process. That can be an afternoon meeting or a couple of sessions to make sure all of your people hear about the values, and hear about them regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rewards--appraisals&quot;&gt;4) REWARDS &amp;amp; APPRAISALS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget sales numbers. Any salesman will tell you they’re based on luck. Your values are the number one thing to reward and they’re always a good time to talk about values. Core values should be the defining measure of everything your company is evaluating. Spell them out and re-write all of your literature, collateral, training manuals and communications in light of your values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communications&quot;&gt;5) COMMUNICATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mentioned above that we won’t point out the obvious. Your company newsletter or emails from the chairman are just a little too obvious, but if they are announcing thematic improvements, success stories or examples, then we’re not going to stop you. Some of your people will have a glut of email to cook through every day, but many will not. A daily email is probably better than a weekly (or worse, monthly) newsletter. Communications are the life and death of any organization and in most cases, organizations are sending out more and better emails, blog posts and themed communications than ever before. Your values belong there, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating what you stand for and the best examples of how the organization embraces corporate responsibility have never been more important. Ultimately defeating and destroying the old guard is why people love the free market system. Let us know in the comments how your organization is highlighting, sharing and growing from the values you share.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>10 things your Employee Scheduling Software should be Sending Out</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-software/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-02T22:43:51-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employee Scheduling Software is working harder than ever, but it’s only to be as effective as what you put into it. Here are ten things you should get out of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-your-employee-scheduling-software-should-be-doing-to-make-your-life-easier-and-your-business-happier&quot;&gt;10 things your Employee Scheduling Software should be doing to make your life easier and your business happier!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Employee-Scheduling-Software-.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Employee-Scheduling-Software-.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling Software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lots of workplace improvements make lots of tough-to-keep promises. Your employee scheduling software probably offered ease of use, happier employees and lots more easier flextime scheduling, too. Hopefully, you’ve seen all that happen. But lot of managers don’t study automated email management tips the way that people in marketing and communications do. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecynicalgirl.com/the-automation-of-human-resources-is-near/&quot;&gt;That may be changing&lt;/a&gt;, but probably not soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point to building and maintaining an automated email system is a lot more than just getting more information in front of your employees. When done properly, you’re working on building a culture of today and one that gets out exactly what it puts into your team or teams. That means, you’re not just sending notes that say “Work today at 4:30” and “Bill called in sick. Who wants another shift?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your employee scheduling software also lets you send out messages anytime you want, exactly like the email system you may already be using to target different teams and to make the entire operation more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to those normal notices, these are ten of the things that should be sent out to make your message clearer, your culture more success-oriented and your productivity skyrocket!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;every-day-is-a-chance-to-commit-to-your-brand&quot;&gt;1) Every day is a chance to commit to your brand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day that you’re reminding people to show up,  you should also be reminding them why they’re on the team. Not hollow appeals to values that upper management betrays, but real reminders of how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201002/what-do-corporate-values-really-mean&quot;&gt;corporate organization adheres to the values&lt;/a&gt; that all of you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continuous-improvement-reminders&quot;&gt;2) Continuous Improvement Reminders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you don’t need to be critical. Every work shift should be a chance to - ready - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/continuous-improvement/&quot;&gt;INVITE CRITICISM!&lt;/a&gt; That means, every time your new schedule goes out you can remind people that it’s up to them to make things better. The challenge for management to is listen, respond and reward those with the most innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establish-refine-and-clarify-goals&quot;&gt;3) Establish, Refine and Clarify Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t have to mean sales or productivity goals, though those might work as well. But sub-goals and step to step encouragement and acknowledgement are the way to go in your regular and automated emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognize-and-acknowledge&quot;&gt;4) Recognize and Acknowledge!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to say “You’re doing a great job.” Some acknowledgement and appreciation  means a lot and gives you better results too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organize&quot;&gt;5) Organize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the crazy things we learn in automating systems is that lots of businesses are disorganized in all kinds of crazy ways. Sending out regular weekly or bi-weekly emails is a great way to always start planning - and &lt;strong&gt;lots of firms find that their schedule mailings work better than the company newsletter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;send-productivity-notes-with-your-regular-mailings&quot;&gt;6) Send productivity notes with your regular mailings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just “work harder” either. Your teams want to know where the numbers are, what their successes have been, and where they stack up next to everyone else. You can customize notes so that everyone gets all or part of the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pick-your-culture-up-off-the-floor&quot;&gt;7) Pick Your Culture Up Off the Floor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. You know that if 1,000 people read this article only ten of them will have the courage to make culture into an issue today in their workplaces. Those are the ten that will succeed too. Most companies run crappy cultures because they are afraid to do something cultural. &lt;strong&gt;Slip something important, personal and true into your mailing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-the-policies-that-do-not-work&quot;&gt;8) Change the Policies that Do Not Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announce them here. Make it matter and tell people why and exactly how the policy was changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-your-regular-mailings-to-build-transparency&quot;&gt;9) Use Your Regular Mailings to Build Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers, Numbers, Numbers. Employees will take the bad news with the good and if it makes sense to them, then they can give you better numbers. It doesn’t hurt to tell people what numbers, and what they mean or might mean, but the more transparent you can be, the better numbers you’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engage&quot;&gt;10) Engage!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You too! Bored, listless, scheduling and HR manager: Get engaged!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any automated email is only ever as good as the person setting it up. So don’t send out the same boring list of days and shifts and hours. Make it good. Make it count and what you get back will count for you too. We can hear your eyes rolling, but the problem is, so can the people reading your emails. Remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>The New Human Resources Definition</title>
   <link href="/blog/human-resources-definition/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-26T23:47:49-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/human-resources-definition</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-resources-definitionhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201401human-resources-definition1jpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201401human-resources-definition1jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Human-Resources-Definition1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Human-Resources-Definition1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Human Resources Definition&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Human Resources Definition is being written right now. It’s not only one of the most central roles in any business, it’s also one that’s changing almost every day!! These 5 new definitions will help you to see your Human Resources Definition more clearly!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;additions-to-the-new-human-resources-definition-that-will-make-it-work-for-you&quot;&gt; 5 Additions to the New Human Resources Definition that Will Make it Work For You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no question now that human resources is changing and changing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to all kinds of other areas of business, the Human Resources Definition of today is more focused than ever before on business success and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human Resources today are focused more than ever on finding, cultivating and keeping the cutting edge skills that keep your business moving. These are some of the most important additions to the 2014 Human Resources Definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-resources-as-values-brokers&quot;&gt;1) Human Resources as Values Brokers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this is the real key to Human Resources success. Values distinguish your organization from every other shop on the market, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130503131505-3257535-10-lessons-in-defining-your-company-values&quot;&gt;your HR people should be focusing on defining and refining them&lt;/a&gt; - and keeping them in front of the eyes of all your key players. Without values, you’re probably running at half-speed or far worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-resources-as-the-ultimate-critic&quot;&gt;2) Human Resources as the Ultimate Critic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need people who dare to challenge at the top. Group think is observed too often. The plans are always ambitious and will result in more growth. Nobody wants to be the party pooper. Nobody wants to be perceived as a blocker. This is where HR can show its independency, and challenge where others choose to be followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-resources-as-data-moguls&quot;&gt;3) Human Resources as Data Moguls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget clock-ins, Human Resources should have front row seats on the data that really matters. From Productivity to KPIs on departments and shifts and times to let people work, or not work - everything that matters is being clocked, analyzed and crunched over in the Human Resources area. What are your HR people focusing on this week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-resources-as-risk-management-whiz-kids&quot;&gt;4) Human Resources as Risk Management Whiz Kids&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk only comes with innovation - and stodgy old HR has never been more innovative. They’re not only brokering values and crunching numbers, but now their actively taking a look at the chances for success of any given initiative. HR is able to predict the success of every new hire and to much better manage the risk of losing talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-resources-as-the-ultimate-marketing-department&quot;&gt;5) Human Resources as the Ultimate Marketing Department&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-advocates/&quot;&gt;Making advocates out of employees &lt;/a&gt;sounds simpler than it is. But HR has the skills and the tools to make employees into fans, to query perceptions and to push for the kinds of changes that workers want. All that sounds expensive, but it doesn’t cost anywhere near as much as having a shop full of workers who hate you and hate your company. That’s a true recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are just five of the most important areas&lt;/strong&gt; where HR should be driving business. NimbleSchedule works with dozens of companies breaking new ground on making employees into happy company advocates and super-productive workers. They not only pull their own weight but in some cases, they push Human Resources into a whole new arena of business prominence. That’s somewhere that Human Resources hasn’t been since the early years of the Industrial Revolution. You can be there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role is changing your Human Resources Definition?&lt;/strong&gt; Let us know in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Smart Teams Need Smart Leaders: Here's How to Be One!</title>
   <link href="/blog/smart-teams/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-19T23:23:14-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/smart-teams</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/smart-teams.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/smart-teams.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;building smart teams&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Smart Teams depend on Smart Tactics to get them learning and growing. Here’s our list of the fastest ways to get your team moving today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-smart-teams-are-the-teams-pulling-forward&quot;&gt;The Smart Teams are the Teams Pulling Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your people calling “Bullshit!” on anything you’ve been saying lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they’re not, then you’ve got a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cowed, timid and disengaged team-members go along with anything, even if it’s the wrong plan of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re the best team leader that you can be, you’re not as smart as the people working for you - and making your team into the smartest possible team is just about the smartest thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best leaders can’t possibly think through all the alternatives that a good team will come up with. A really rich exchange of ideas is one that opens up all kinds of options and alternatives. And yes, that’s where all the solutions to all kinds of problems are going to come from. Understanding your goals, communicating them and striving for them - with your team - takes some works. See some good &lt;a href=&quot;http://business.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Examples_of_SMART_Goals_and_Objectives&quot;&gt;examples of goals and objectives&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you should do to make your team into a smart team and one that can confront any situation constructively with an eye on the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;include-the-bottom-of-the-totem-pole---in-top-level-decisions&quot;&gt;1) Include the Bottom of the Totem Pole - in Top Level Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people actually doing the work have a lot more insight than you might think. Make sure they know you’re backing them up and that you understand the strengths each team member brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;add-transparency-to-the-team-mix&quot;&gt;2) Add Transparency to the Team Mix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leader’s role is to ensure that every part of the team understands and works well with the rest of the team. Make talking through disagreements the standard operating procedure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reward-success-meaningfully&quot;&gt;3) Reward Success Meaningfully&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often say, in this blog, that this is a lot easier said than done. Pizza Parties don’t cut it, but a half-day off costs nothing and gets remembered long afterward. As an incentive, free time and time off or flexible scheduling can mean a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encourage-wrong-options&quot;&gt;4) Encourage Wrong Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few brain stormers ever get as far as understanding that &lt;strong&gt;good cognition depends on carefully considering incorrect and obviously failed options.&lt;/strong&gt; That could mean encouraging your team to come up with the most obvious solutions. But it also means, coming up with those that don’t work, couldn’t work, or will never work in a million years. Put them on paper, or on the white board or back into the proposal and talk about them. You’ll be surprised at how well this opens up new solutions, and encourages teams to work through creative solutions with less fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eliminate-fear&quot;&gt;5) Eliminate Fear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate the ridiculous, the obscure and the not quite totally baked does not mean celebrating failure. Whatever your team is doing, even if their best efforts don’t quite work, if they put it all out there, then the leaders job is to make sure that every one learns from the mistakes and improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams need to explore or they are just making the same mistakes over and over again. We’ve seen this far more times than times than most business leaders would even think is possible. And yes, bigger organizations can stay in the “mistakes only holding pattern” for years and years and year. It’s expensive and useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at it this way: Getting somewhere means taking some risks. Business failure needs to be regularly planned for and accounted for and mitigated. Your competition is doubtless even more mired in “bullshit” than you are, so don’t let them be the ones to call you on it. Leadership means taking it, sometimes taking it on the chin, and learning from the experience. Going back to the same old practices is really what needs to be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Scheduling Continuous Improvement into Day to Day Operations</title>
   <link href="/blog/continuous-improvement/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-12T23:23:53-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/continuous-improvement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;_&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/continuous-improvement.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/continuous-improvement.png&quot; alt=&quot;continuous improvement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Continuous Improvement shouldn’t be a special part of management. It’s fundamental to keep any business in business. Scheduling it just makes it that much easier.
_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plug-continuous-improvement-right-into-your-work-day&quot;&gt;Plug Continuous Improvement Right Into Your Work Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous Improvement has been largely embraced as a solution to problems of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Profitability&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2) Productivity
3) Employee Morale&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4) Environment and Working Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Profitability -&lt;/strong&gt; Working to continually analyze procedures lets managers roll back overhead costs and improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2) Productivity - **The  competition is always going to be exploiting the latest and greatest to make sure they’re getting the most out of every customer, tool and method. These need to be maximized and shared widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Employee Morale -&lt;/strong&gt; You really can’t underestimate the benefits - in terms of profitability and productivity - of happy employees. Discouraged and dejected employees are doubtless costing any company more than they’re worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Work Environment -&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous improvement very often shows up most obviously in terms of immediate environmental factors. Changes should be noted and, where possible, the story of each improvement will work to benefit your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instilling a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbr.org/2013/07/the-culture-to-cultivate/ar/1&quot;&gt;culture of continuous improvements&lt;/a&gt; is also one of the chief concerns of business managers, almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgement&quot;&gt;Acknowledgement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging and recognizing the problem is a huge step. Convincing principles that the value is there can be a huge obstacle. But don’t give up too soon. Though the larger organization will nearly always benefit from recognizing and confronting the problem, solutions can also be addressed at the departmental or sub-level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever level you’re looking at, leadership is the number one prerequisite. And although resistance to change is nearly omnipresent in any kind of organization, Continuous Improvement is, in some sense, the answer to that resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimble Schedule is designed to provide ease of use in implementing gradual or step-by-step improvement or a totally drastic, now or never, do-or-die kind of solution. Which you choose is totally up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plugging your Continuous Improvement in should look a little like this with regard to each of the above-mentioned areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;profitability&quot;&gt;1) Profitability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the below is ultimately about profitability. The more and better improvements you make, the more information you’ll have to continuously improve the bottom line, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;productivity&quot;&gt;2) Productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happier, freer and “more adult” employees are always more productive. In terms of plugging it in officially, we’ve seen employees using calendar and scheduling software to continually update management on conditions and specifications of shifts, hours, workload and, yes, improvements. **
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employee-morale&quot;&gt;3) Employee Morale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing employees more freedom and more work-life balance is a terrific way to open things up and get better results. You’re also allowing them to provide more and more feedback as to what is working and what is not. At the end of the day, that’s what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;environment-and-working-conditions&quot;&gt;4) Environment and Working Conditions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous Improvements depend on process centered thinking. For that you need processes in place and you need to know   to continually improve, correct, and overcome execution difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, as mentioned above, employing or implementing a calendar system allows you to vastly improve morale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) By implementing a continuous, regular and ongoing two-way communications system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) It works by email, but you can ramp it up with text or the internet for really good, ongoing communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) You’re also including far more of your employees in the process. That makes them happier and your organization smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) Identifying and executing new ideas, process and methods is a lot easier when you have a highly productive team already plugged into a process of ongoing, continuous improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work regularly to get more Continuous Improvement ideas plugged into a regular schedule. The chief way to get started is to encourage ongoing, regular contact and a good exchange of ideas with no penalties for criticism or whistle-blowing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2014 Staffing Tips to Keep You in Business!</title>
   <link href="/blog/staffing-tips/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-06T00:14:42-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/staffing-tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/staffing-tips1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/staffing-tips1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;staffing tips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Staffing tips come and go, but keeping personnel happy and productive is a full time job. It really should be one of the most pleasant jobs in your shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;easy-staffing-tips-to-make-2014-the-best-year-yet&quot;&gt;13 Easy Staffing Tips to Make 2014 the Best Year Yet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some industries are still struggling under the crush of labor shortages, dis-engaged and dispirited workers and a lack of over all productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re losing money while the best people keep walking out the door - pay attention. These 20 tips are designed to give your best people a reason to stay and your second tier people a reason to do their best. They’re cost effective and they’re a lot easier to implement than costly enterprise software or any technological solutions. Keep it simple, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Internal Communications and HR Management are every day full-time jobs.&lt;/strong&gt; They’re not going to go away so get used to them and get people on the job. (It’s described below.)
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Be consistent.&lt;/strong&gt; Every day is enough. But skipping days here and there erodes the process and erodes your success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Variety is the Key!&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t communicate the same things every day or even on the same day of each week (achievements - Monday, goals - Tuesday, etc.). Mix up messages every day and use a calendar to ensure that your internal communications are as varied and interesting as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Calendar is a verb. &lt;/strong&gt;Well, we said that above. Use a calendar. Calendar everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5) Know where you’re going and why.  **Build a strategy. Put it on your calendar. Make it public and work towards real goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hrschoolhouse.com/robinschooling/internal-communication-in-a-collaborative-world/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Internal Communication is a collaborative process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Be ready to listen. Be able to listen. Make sure everyone who has something to say is heard. Everyone else should be primed to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Make individual goals important and clear.&lt;/strong&gt; Not just sales goals, but personnel development goals and educational goals too. &lt;strong&gt;Keep them on the table&lt;/strong&gt; and you’ll see how well people keep focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Make sure leaders are addressing teams and groups - not individuals.&lt;/strong&gt;
This is one of the real keys to team building and interdependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) Build Respect into Your Culture.&lt;/strong&gt; Work toward recognizing everyone on your team so that they know that YOU KNOW - they’re people with needs, aspirations and goals. Talk about all of them - frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Encourage all employees to eat better and drink more water.&lt;/strong&gt; Just imagine if your boss had told you that? Does it solve every issue in business? No, but it makes management acknowledge that all the people helping out are just that - PEOPLE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11) Prioritize collaboration and teamwork.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, not sales numbers, but problems collaboratively solved should take the lion’s share of limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** 12) Understand recognition.**  It’s not really about celebrating the same kinds of numbers week after week. Recognize the contributions of as many team workers as possible and do it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13) Make recognition personal.&lt;/strong&gt; That doesn’t have to mean &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt;. Probably more important are personal notes - even handwritten notes - by team leaders to the staff being recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot less expensive than pay raises and it makes more sense, too. Do all of these steps and we’ll return to some pointers that not only make your work place happier, but more productive too.

   <title>Teamwork Training: 8 Tips to Get Your People onto One Team</title>
   <link href="/blog/teamwork-training/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-15T23:42:59-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/teamwork-training</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teamwork training doesn’t have to be a big ticket item. Follow these eight pointers and you’ll see your people coming together as a team - today!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_750” align=”alignright” width=”271”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2010_SJHL_Champions.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/teamwork-training1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tips for teamwork training&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Teamwork Training is not just for Sports Teams&lt;/strong&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teamwork-training-in-eight-easy-steps&quot;&gt;Teamwork Training in Eight Easy Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork training takes some brains.&lt;/strong&gt; You can think it’s all motivation and bravado and high fives - but you’d be woefully wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You simply can’t “rah - rah - rah” people from divergent backgrounds and roles into one cohesive body. Teams are sophisticated, complex and dynamic groups. Your strategy for building one needs to be equally lithe, flexible and firm. Follow these 8 tips, and work them with your team leaders and get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;divide-all-tasks-evenly-and-fairly&quot;&gt;1) Divide All Tasks Evenly and Fairly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimize overlap. Teams working well can handle tremendous amounts of work. Break it down and make each role matter. Make sure tasks lists are regularly itemized and publicly posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-names&quot;&gt;2) Learn Names&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure everyone else learns everyone else’s names. If you’ve got a few lost players, then you’ve got a losing team. People don’t have to like each other, but they do need to work together. Knowing your team-mates is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-goals&quot;&gt;3) Review Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a note of the personal goals of every team member. &lt;strong&gt;Here’s the important thing: Individual goals last longer than projects.&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure your team members’ goals align - one way or another - with your project goals and your longer term organizational goals. Bring it all out in the open, and regularly review how each team member is doing with their own goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meet-regularly&quot;&gt;4) Meet Regularly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same place, same time. Use quick, hard-hitting meetings to regularly update that itemization, re-divide and review. Honor success. Acknowledge failure. But don’t waste people’s time with meetings that go nowhere and that just review information better sent in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-leaders-are-not-the-opposition&quot;&gt;5) Team Leaders are NOT the Opposition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than opposing ideas (any ideas) brainstorm for consequences. Encourage all ideas, and write down even the very worst. In fact, start with the worst and run through the consequences. Then progressively go for better and better ideas. Make sure everyone’s ideas are included and, again, make sure they’re all written down. Meeting humidity dissipates, but the written word will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;include-everyone-and-monitor-feelings&quot;&gt;6) Include Everyone, and Monitor Feelings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sabotage is seldom an overt act. Lots of team members will “strike” simply by sitting out, distracting themselves or refusing to budge. Make sure everyone’s ideas are heard and that everyone has a stake in the success of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;praise&quot;&gt;7) Praise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your most humble people will hate it. Do it anyway. Make a review and acknowledgement a regular part of every meeting. Review who is not receiving praise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;8) Lead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is the toughest one of all. Be there. Or make sure someone is there. If you’re a hands off kind of leader, then it’s probably already better. But make sure you know who’s got skin in the game, who are the stake-holders, who is due for praise and whose failures need to be rectified, fixed and reworked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the things above need to be reviewed, processed and personalized by your team leaders. They might be re-worked but no team will leave anyone behind. And if you can handle all of this, then you’re well on your way to leading your team to the championship that every one of them is envisioning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Workplace Motivation: Ten Steps to Getting Everybody Moving</title>
   <link href="/blog/workplace-motivation/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-08T23:21:16-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/workplace-motivation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ha_Ha_Toy_%E2%80%93_Tin_Wind_Up_%E2%80%93_High_Wheel_Robot_%E2%80%93_Chrome_Version_%E2%80%93_Front.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/workplace-motivation1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;work place motivations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Workplace Motivation is right up there with the most important things you’ll tackle in 2014. These ten pointers will make it easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workplace-motivation-in-ten-easy-steps&quot;&gt;Workplace Motivation in Ten Easy Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workplace motivation is not just about getting more out of people for less time and the same money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about engagement, getting better productivity, higher interest and more happiness. You end up with people who better represent your company and who better reinforce your company mission, values and who ultimately make yours into a more profitable and efficient enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do these Ten Things and you’ll see better results from your entire enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clarify-your-company-values&quot;&gt;1) Clarify Your (Company) Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramp up your internal communications so that your people are continually learning, from you, and from the organization as whole. We put this one first because it’s so important. Be clear. Work with a good editor to continually revise and restate the company positions and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen&quot;&gt;2) Listen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps are going to get simpler, but let’s start with the most important. Be clear in what you say - and EVEN CLEARER in your listening. If you haven’t worked on your company values, then start listening and listening good. Then write down your values based on what you learned. Make sure something about listening is in there. Make sure everyone in any kind of leadership position is listening and is approachable and communicates that they are ready to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eliminate-prejudice&quot;&gt;3) Eliminate Prejudice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be part of your values statement anyway, but we’re not necessarily talking about overt racism or discrimination. Far more important is prejudice in your performance evaluations and personal impressions. Treat people fairly even if you don’t like them and push for more openness and inclusiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eliminate-pettiness&quot;&gt;4) Eliminate Pettiness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is great. Practice it and promote work life balance. Don’t let small issues of lateness or too much time off interfere with your evaluations of your best people. Forget about small infractions and talk about work life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-goals&quot;&gt;5) Set Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more important, talk about them. Oh. And we’re not talking about company wide or departmental goals. Work with employees company-wide and talk about THEIR GOALS. Institutionalize the practice. Reward achievement.  See below…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognize-greatness&quot;&gt;6) Recognize Greatness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to work on time and having a successful day is terrific. Doing that and raising three kids is outstanding. Recognize and talk about all of the things that all of your people are doing. See #2 above. Listen, then communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognize-more-people-everyday&quot;&gt;7) Recognize More People Everyday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, put this one in your values statement. Learn more people’s names. Understand more of what they do. And make sure your leadership people are doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appreciate-the-finer-things&quot;&gt;8) Appreciate the Finer Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership can be measured in every aspect of your office experience. It can be measured outside the office and in your peoples’ jobs and in their lives. People are not coming to your company everyday for what you want. They’ve come for what they want. Make more of it. Celebrate them and give them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-avoid-the-issues-any-issues&quot;&gt;9) Don’t Avoid the Issues (any Issues)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems have a way of festering, growing and multiplying. If there are attitudes that need adjusting, get someone in there quick to adjust them. If they’re problems in your leadership then they are probably worse than you think. Tackle them and cut the worst offenders off and show them to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practice-humility&quot;&gt;10) Practice Humility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it sounds very Zen. Most working people will consider it an act of humility if the CEO simply learns their name and says hello to them. Learn what they do, take an interest in any and all of it. All of that is humility. Do we need to say? Get it into your company values statement and get it right. Practice it. Make it real. Then you’ll be motivating others and making money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice all of the above starting today. Getting people moving means getting yourself moving. It does mean practicing what you are preaching too. But after all is said and done, it’s also a lot easier than what it sounds too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Organizational Culture: Let's Make It Work Again</title>
   <link href="/blog/organizational-culture/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-01T00:05:31-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/organizational-culture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;organizational-culturehttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201312organizational-culture-jpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201312organizational-culture-jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/organizational-culture-.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/organizational-culture-.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;organizational culture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational culture is as big anything else on the Talent Management and HR menu. It’s also front and center for managers of any stripe. Let’s make it work for your people, and for your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organizational-culture&quot;&gt;Organizational Culture:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;six-steps-to-a-company-worth-learning-from&quot;&gt;Six Steps to a Company Worth Learning From&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot gets written about organizational culture. Like employee engagement, workplace culture is a hot fire burning but very few work places manage to get reins around the wild horses that romp through their open-floor plan. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/1810674/culture-eats-strategy-lunch&quot;&gt;Culture may even eat strategy for Lunch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at implementing each of the following, and you’ll see your employees more actively engaged, and more actively advocating for your bigger, broader picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Rely on a Good Statement of Values and Purpose&lt;/strong&gt; and not just on a stale company mission statement. Direct it to the outside - but understand you’re building something good on the inside. That’s why they’re called “values”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Make Sure Everyone is Aligned.&lt;/strong&gt; How do you do this?  Ask them. Or make sure your people are asking them. Understanding employee goals is absolutely vital to the proper alignment of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Creating Excitement is Good. Do it in Moderation.&lt;/strong&gt; A couple of symbolic gestures can’t hurt - but employees, just like customers, will see right through phoney gestures and false enthusiasm. A couple of events a year are sufficient. Do semesters, or trimesters. Monthly and quarterly is probably too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 ) Explain the Structure of Teams.&lt;/strong&gt; Know where you need help and what helpers are necessary, but make sure everyone knows. Make sure that people know who is smarter than you. Make sure that management are NOT just posing as smart people but that they are managing truly smart people and that they are aware that there charges are smarter. Make sure the charges no too. Suddenly you’re talking about true cooperative everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Educate and Train. &lt;/strong&gt; But before that, explain the process, the reason and THE GOALS. Keep in mind. A workforce that is learning and auto-educating is a workforce that is engaged. Celebrate their achievements just the same as big expensive training sessions. And keep in constant conversation how the training is applied toward meeting goals and the Values Statement above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Acknowledge all Innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous improvements to process, thinking, and models - as well as products or service - need to be noted and acknowledged. This is a culture of innovation. If they’re feeling stuck, then you need to publicly celebrate innovation from where? From Culture. And you can borrow from the very highest culture. Think opera, symphonic music and visual arts. Talk about them. Learn from them, or have the real enthusiasts share what they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the above is terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially to engrained, old-school management. These people are likely costing you a fortune for the sake of avoiding trouble. Usually that means they’re avoiding trouble for themselves. You’d fire lesser people in a heartbeat for avoiding doing their jobs, so why are holding onto management that instills a culture of depression, loss and ease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of holding a meeting to ask people, start issuing directives aimed at building out that Values List, and then following up on it. Get management on your side, and if they’re not on your side, then what are they doing there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Internal Communications for Workplace Success</title>
   <link href="/blog/internal-communications/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-24T23:21:14-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/internal-communications</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/internal-communications-0011.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/internal-communications-0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;internal-communications-001&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Internal Communications may be MORE important than the messaging you do outside your company. That’s especially true if you’ve got people speaking on your behalf!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;internal-communications-for-workplace-success&quot;&gt;Internal Communications for Workplace Success!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every article we post here comes down - in one sense or another - to your ability to communicate the plan. With that, let’s take a quick look at what you are doing and can do better to get the message across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;group-meetings&quot;&gt;1. Group Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most over-rated communications device in the history of sitting down with other people. In short, most companies don’t realize what cannot be said in a meeting, don’t make any effort to get at it and end up with a couple of hours completely wasted and the wrong message communicated. If your new offices were designed to hold lots of simultaneous meetings, then you probably have a meeting-dependent staff who attend simply because they are obligated and who could not care less what is the outcome. A colleague once said to this author, “I’ve never attended a meeting that couldn’t have been handled better in a memo.” Work to eliminate group meetings and convert the space into break rooms where actual work can get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;face-to-face&quot;&gt;2. Face to Face&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there is a lot to be said for communication face to face. Two people can solve any problem you can throw at them, but there needs to be trust, willingness to listen and confidence. If your people aren’t talking then no amount of meetings will help. (See the part about break rooms above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-email&quot;&gt;3. Internal Email&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies use it, sort of. Smaller HR staffs depend on it. Larger companies depend on a whole Internal Communications department, and they still often get it wrong. The main thing overlooked is the alignment of goals and priorities with the company’s stated, repeated and posted values and mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company really can have someone from HR typing of policies, announcements, inspirational notes, news and changes. There’s nothing wrong with that. But increasingly, mid-sized and smaller companies are relying on professional communicators, from marketing and communications areas, to better craft and hone the ultimate message - and to be sure it’s in-line with the over all company mission. Don’t neglect the importance of good quality emails. A typo won’t kill you, but indifference will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there someone on the other end to receive replies to your emails?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;company-newsletter&quot;&gt;4. Company Newsletter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another area that gets too often neglected. Hire a professional if necessary, but your newsletter should be vital for every employee - exactly as your company is vital to them. If you can’t find news, again, bring in a professional - or your star talent - and have them point out what’s important to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surveys&quot;&gt;5. Surveys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a tidal wave of companies and consultancies hocking “employee engagement surveys” right now. It’s always amusing what companies will pay to avoid engaging with their employees. Here’s the secret you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If management isn’t prepared to receive feedback on the job they’re doing then you need different management. Some companies can’t handle too much feedback all at once, and that’s understandable. Make anonymous, no-holds-barred surveys a regular, weekly part of your operations. A twenty dollar account with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;SurveyMonkey.com&lt;/a&gt; will save you a fortune and engage your people, and maybe even put a fire under your management teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;6. Training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the above, this one doesn’t often go totally wrong. But keep in mind, training is not just for skills, but a chance to get your message across, and to learn yourself. Classroom settings can go horribly wrong - especially in meeting-dependent companies where employees are accustomed to sitting and doing nothing in a room with other people. Plan carefully with your facilitators, trainers and teachers. Make sure HR keeps an open relationship with them and that changes in culture and message are well understood. And obviously, this is not a ruler on the knuckles kind of school room. Use the time well. Make sure that the right people are there to listen and learn - from the students!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside your company,&lt;/strong&gt; there are these ways and more to reinforce and expand a culture of engagement, learning and communication. These are some of the most important - but most important of all is that all of your communications are two way. Inside and out, you’ll learn more from listening than from talking. Do you have the right people listening?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee and Corporate Goals Definitions and Alignment</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-and-corporate-goals-definitions/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-17T23:24:44-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-and-corporate-goals-definitions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Employee-and-Corporate-Goals-Definitions.png.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Employee-and-Corporate-Goals-Definitions.png.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee-and-Corporate-Goals-Definitions.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Employee and Corporate Goals Definitions need to be widely understood, accepted and aligned, so that they match. Less than that and you’re likely working in a muddle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-and-corporate-goals&quot;&gt;Employee and Corporate Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definitions-and-alignment&quot;&gt;Definitions and Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals are tough nuts to crack.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve written in the past about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-satisfaction/&quot;&gt;insisting upon Employee Goals.&lt;/a&gt; Often a bigger problem is that corporate goals are little understood, not agreed upon and not even well disseminated (communicated) throughout the organization. Try aligning that with your employees’ own individual goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that smaller companies with fewer employees have it easy. But you’ll be surprised how few of them have clearly defined and little understood goals. If “making money” were a legitimate goal, then we’d all be in the clear. The fact is, for most organizations, it’s the only goal and it fails spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worker productivity gets lost in the mix, in part, because their goals are not your goals and neither of you understand each other. In part, it comes down to communications, but it also comes down to openly establishing, understanding and reinforcing your mutual commitment to reaching each other’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aligning-individual-and-organizational-goals&quot;&gt;Aligning Individual and Organizational Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on Internal Communications is not always an easy task. But to really get to the bottom of your goals misalignment issue, having a working, functional two-way Internal Communications program in place is essential. Your employees should already know that you want to hear from them and that you want to hear from the regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re moving from a “money, money, money” no-goals mental framework, to one that puts values first, and that respects your employees goals, then you need to be regularly polling, surveying and soliciting feedback from employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no two ways about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before you leap ahead to your post-“money, money, money” goals as an organization, keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You haven’t heard your employees’ goals yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you get from asking for them and reading the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real insight into who is working for you&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real insight into how you can satisfy them (and keep them)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A much stronger idea of what your broader organizational goals might look like&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to go about getting these goals from your employees, but you SHOULD NOT ask them to answer multiple choice questions or choose goals from a list. That’s a bad disengagement tactic that’s going to make you look lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can ask them to write an email, or you can create a simple survey and ask them to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best done by team, and obviously, larger organizations need more people looking at, commenting on and supporting the goals of your employees. The more people involved, the better informed your broader organization will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning these goals should be done with reference to your organizations stated and published list of values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really can dictate strategic goals to all of your teams and all of your people. But they tend to make more sense if they’re based on and developed from real insight into who and what your company is. Make sure they line up, complement one another and include the reaching of the goals of your people, especially your top people and your best performers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five Key Points for Today's Employee Recognition</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-recognition/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-10T23:35:34-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-recognition</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Employee-Recognition1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Employee-Recognition1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee-Recognition&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Employee recognition it not just a monthly plaque on the wall. But it’s almost as easy, liberating, and worth working on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-recognition-that-your-best-players-will-actually-remember&quot;&gt;Employee Recognition that Your Best Players will Actually Remember&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of your employees are impressed by the old “Employee of the Month” you might just re-consider that employee. The rest of us roll our eyes, believe none of it, and question your honesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand that management is busy. Too busy for us. But we don’t quite get how a hollow effort like that is still hanging on. Just drop it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to recognize your employees then keep thee couple of points in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number one, you should be recognizing behaviors, actions, responses and techniques&lt;/strong&gt; - not results, sales or numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, hire a writer to describe appropriate and effective behaviors that align with your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;company’s core values&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure your writer understands the values, and send them out again by email to your whole company. No stickers, no plaques, no trophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number two, make sure that the vast majority of your organization or your company can actively participate in your recognition program.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to being a great engagement exercise, it’s also a terrific way to put your core company values back in front of employees again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure every employee can see how those values are useful and make sure this document &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be shared with the public. (It doesn’t have to be.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core company values are going to provide more than just another plaque, but if you’ve visited before, you already know they’re something that gets a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does recognition look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it really doesn’t have to be money. Employees are far more interested in gestures toward work-life balance. Working from home and more flex time or just more freedom are wildly successful at keeping people happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re actually big activists about the Flexi-time rewards package and completely voluntary employee scheduling because it tends to show fast, noticeable and robust results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also spot lunches, and have a face to face. Or get managers to do it. The point is this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, what about management recognition?&lt;/strong&gt; This is powerful one. You’ll meet tons of resistance and get to throw out some of the people who are really holding your company back and probably costing you a fortune. But keep it constructive, open, honest and as transparent as possible but without necessarily requiring confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know already who the good people managers are. If managers are costing you people then they are costing you money too, and probably lots of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee recognition takes a lot of forms. Sales numbers are a big loser, but on average, they are one of the few KPIs that most managers are looking at. Work with your managers to explore other KPIs that can be recognized and pinned down, and then set up a system where employees are actively voting for their co-workers - and managers - who best reflect those KPIs and the core values. There’s really no way you are going to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Ways to Change Workplace Culture Today</title>
   <link href="/blog/change-workplace-culture/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-03T23:19:16-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/change-workplace-culture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/workplace-culture.png.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/workplace-culture.png.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;workplace-culture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can you do to change workplace culture? You might be surprised. It takes a meeting or two, but the benefits far outweigh the risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ways-to-change-workplace-culture-without-risking-a-thing&quot;&gt;5 Ways to Change Workplace Culture Without Risking a Thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/social-media-policy/&quot;&gt;change workplace culture, we said last time&lt;/a&gt;, is among the most important and lasting contributions any manager can make. It sounds more difficult than it is, but those who succeed are still going to be recognized as if they were true cultural icons, at least within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the five things you need to do to change your workplace culture starting today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Stop the idea of non-skilled workers. &lt;/strong&gt; Root it out and get rid of it. Follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-satisfaction/&quot;&gt;our steps to employee satisfaction, closely,&lt;/a&gt; carefully, and the result will be skilled employees. Satisfied employees reached the goals you helped them to set out for themselves, and all of them became skilled employees in the process. They know they are valuable, self-evaluating and more satisfied people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Worry about Environment.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve gone on about this in the past, but give your employees some say in the whole thing. It doesn’t mean a foozeball table. Group break areas and public areas are important but they’re not everything. Make sure your people have some say and can customize how things are arranged and how they look and feel. Open floorplans are everywhere, but they aren’t the answer to everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Adults Only.&lt;/strong&gt; That should sound bold. And it is. Make sure that all of your people get the idea and act accordingly. But especially management need to know that skilled employees expect to be treated like adults. Some of your old school managers may still be following the old “School-Marm Knows Best” policy. Treating your superiors like grown-ups and your “underlings” like children needs to go out the door. If not, then your managers need to be seeing the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Bring Everyone on Board.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like we always say, communicate clearly, make sure everyone gets the message and articulate a vision based on values and common purpose. If every company did that there wouldn’t be engagement levels across the board at 30% and lower. There are literally companies still somehow functioning where absolutely every employee hates the boss, is indifferent to the product and couldn’t care less if the company went bankrupt tomorrow. That’s not where you want to be working. Even if you really are in a nasty business you can improve the internal thinking and make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) To change workplace culture really does require culture.&lt;/strong&gt; It doesn’t need to be HIGH CULTURE, but it should be human culture, popular culture and everyday people culture. Think about all of the above with reference not only to work-life-balance but with reference to books and music, visual arts and communications, and to the fact that all of your people have preferences and tastes. They like being exposed to things as a group that they can’t find out on their own or individually. An organization like yours is the perfect place to orchestrate exposure, conversation and participation in many of the things that people often come together to share. Don’t make it complicated. Sports and fitness work, encourage them, and reward employees with real flexible work hours and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all topics for your company newsletter or for your training and expectations-building seminars. Don’t settle for less.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Social Media Policy for Engaged Employees, and HR Satisfaction</title>
   <link href="/blog/social-media-policy/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-28T00:20:28-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/social-media-policy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/social-media-policy1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/social-media-policy1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;social-media-policy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A real social media policy is the taunting, mysterious ghost hanging in front of many HR managers. But don’t put it off forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-social-media-policy-for-engagement&quot;&gt;A Social Media Policy for Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-talent-retention&quot;&gt;AND Talent Retention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrote last time about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-advocates/&quot;&gt;using social media to make your newly happy employees just a little more pro-company.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, nearly everybody wants their employees to support the company, do the recruiting and do the marketing. It’s not that far out of the question but how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, giving them the freedom to use social media is one way,&lt;/strong&gt; but the big scary snake in that basket is the question of an official, like corporate social media policy. How do you even begin to herd all the cats into agreement on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like our metaphors, snakes and cats don’t mix up well, and like there are dozens of different players with stakes in this game, there are lots of things to consider. Here’s how you can bring them all together and not lose too much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;developing-a-social-media-policy-in-five-steps-that-work&quot;&gt;Developing a Social Media Policy in Five Steps that Work!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-know-where-youre-stepping&quot;&gt;Step 1) Know where you’re stepping!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the goals of a sound social media policy is absolutely fundamental. Almost every week we refer back to the point of a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;Values Driven Culture.&lt;/a&gt;” Any time a policy issue comes up it’s going to work better if it fits in with what’s already established. If we’re talking about values, well it makes that much more sense. For marketing, recruitment and overall engagement, you’re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-customize---to-your-own-culture&quot;&gt;Step 2) Customize - to your own Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been famously argued that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/is-culture-more-important-than-strategy/&quot;&gt;culture is more important than strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Take that one to heart. Social media policies are as different as businesses and cultures. They’re also as flexible as your business needs to be, but they should reflect your core values and to your core culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-consult-with-every-department&quot;&gt;Step 3) Consult with every department&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different departments have different goals and even different cultures. Knowing what they want is as important as predicting their possible struggles or problems. When you’ve consulted with everyone you can more equitably plan policies that allow everyone more freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-remind-those-lower-on-the-totem-pole-of-the-goals&quot;&gt;Step 4) Remind those lower on the totem pole of the goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one frequently gets overlooked. Engaged employees want to understand the how and why of any policy changes. Their enthusiasm may very well depend on the explicit articulation of goals - including increased freedom to advocated, trumpet or sing praises. If that’s not their job normally, there’s simply no reason to believe they’ll start doing it now without explicit instructions and encouragement. That goes for helpful sharing, liking and tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-promote-widely&quot;&gt;Step 5) Promote Widely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After review by legal and everyone else who needs to know, get it out there. You’re people will be pleased with their increased access, and that they aren’t working in the dark ages, or an old decrepit insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, engaging employees is a first step to engaging clients and customers,&lt;/strong&gt; and it may be a way to entice candidates, too. It’s also sometimes slow, and it can have a very short memory. Some disasters even go away quickly, to everyone’s relief. But don’t let avoiding disaster dictate every decision you make, you end up &lt;em&gt;infantilizing&lt;/em&gt; good employees - and muffling your entire message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But working with all of your employees is a great way for many smaller companies to seem much, much bigger. And a company with twenty engaged employees is suddenly competing, quite admirably, with competitor 10X or even 100X bigger, and much better armed. Perhaps that’s the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Advocates From Sound Social Media Policy</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-advocates/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-21T00:32:49-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-advocates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/employee-engagement1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/employee-engagement1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee advocates&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everyone talks about engaging employees for the bottom line, but engaged employees are also “employee advocates” for your HR department and for your entire brand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-you-really-make-employee-advocates-on-social-media&quot;&gt;Can you really make Employee Advocates on Social Media?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-retention-and-engagement-basics/&quot;&gt;Employee engagement&lt;/a&gt; is one of the biggest buzzwords ever to rattle HR departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, interested people are going to do better work and show better results and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-engagement-and-employee-retention/&quot;&gt;Happy and productive workers &lt;/a&gt;are going to do better at their own jobs, but they also tend to be infectious and do the work of a lot of other people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;people-trust-people---not-companies-and-not-brands---people&quot;&gt;People Trust People - Not Companies and Not Brands - PEOPLE!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine if your marketing department were able to rely on all of the people from all of the other areas of your business to do at least some of the marketing and messaging and publicity for them? You’d have a totally different image and a very different bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it’s possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the obvious, beyond the productivity, and the positive numbers, turning your workers into intelligent human beings and professionals - you’re also them into publicists, recruiters and fans. That’s the first step toward converting more of your customers into fans too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing you need to do now is to nail down a Corporate Social Media Policy that’s as strong as your attendance policy and your brand messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting clear guidelines about employee social media use sounds like you are going to police every comma and period in your entire organization. But it doesn’t have to be difficult or stressful or a police state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Define what is being shared -&lt;/strong&gt; It can be news, coupons or stories, or any other content. It can and should be content that is relevant to your industry but not advertisements for your business. So if you sell houses, it can be relevant to your market, such as pricing indexes and neighborhood guides. Good news is best where ever possible. Worry about people being authentic, not about message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2) Define the Rewards - **What’s in it for me? Incentives play a major role, especially if your employees are not totally engaged. If they’re still on the fence about how great you are, a paid afternoon off should inspire them. If they are engaged then make it competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**3) Track Results - **There are dozens of ways to keep track and even follow analytics but make them public, and do it regularly. Recognize those participating and reward them publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Align everything with a corporate policy.&lt;/strong&gt; But be reasonable too. Of course there will be a few things that are expressly forbidden like on the internet as a whole, and for most businesses they are exactly the same as on the Internet as a whole. But your employees will be pleasantly surprised (and further engaged) to learn how human upper management is (or can be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in the real world Internet, it’s totally optional, but the rewards are only for those who opt in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may need to seek further advice on defining and implementing a comprehensive social media policy for your entire organization. &lt;strong&gt;We’ll be returning to the theme of social media policy for HR&lt;/strong&gt; in another post, because for some businesses with more sensitive or highly secure environments you really do have to look into it. But don’t ever think it is too difficult or too much work. The key thing is, the more you trust your engaged employees, the more rewards you’ll reap from them, and they from you!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Motivating Employees: It Takes Leadership!</title>
   <link href="/blog/motivating-employees/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-14T01:01:39-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/motivating-employees</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Column_of_Victory,_Blenheim_Palace_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1485396.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/motivating-employees.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee motivation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Motivating employees is good for production, engagement and ultimately for your bottom line. So why do so many “leaders” fail to make the grade?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivating-employees&quot;&gt;Motivating Employees:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-takes-leadership&quot;&gt;It Takes Leadership!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is talking about Engagement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it’s the latest thing in human resources. The ultimate in increasing workplace productivity and profits. The core even before your core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more basically, simply motivating employees - even before they go and get engaged, is also a key component to your management task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what’s the even more bizarre and hot-potato buzzword?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leadership&quot;&gt;Leadership?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no better understood than it was during the Eisenhower administration despite countless workshops, forums, even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/met/programs/graduate/leadership/&quot;&gt;entire Master’s Degree programs&lt;/a&gt;. “Leadership” still baffles many of the people tasked with actually providing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a clue. It doesn’t require understanding leadership. It’s just something good people do, and other good people start following them, in part, because they are good people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders understand that loyalty is a two way street. If a leader is loyal to his or her workers, or followers, then the leader will get loyalty in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;demonstrate-commitment&quot;&gt;Demonstrate Commitment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Every week we seem to link back, again, to that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;Define Your Corporate Values article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be very clear&lt;/strong&gt; about what you’re about, about what the organization is about and the service you provide. This is why some of those values need to come from you and they need to be demonstrable - in your day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;live-your-company-culture&quot;&gt;Live Your Company Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be passionate. Be the embodiment of what the company stands for, and hopefully it stands for something. If it doesn’t, then make it stand for something. Trust? Loyalty? Are those just buzzwords from your marketing department?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company culture may very well be the single most important factor&lt;/strong&gt; for retaining talent and encouraging engagement. Have you thought about it lately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;celebrate-even-failure&quot;&gt;Celebrate Even Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe celebrate failure more. Every step is a learning experience. Every point closer to success needs to be highlighted and celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is to be engaged. With learning. Doing things like you’ve always done them IS PARALYSIS - not success. A leader is nothing if not engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-a-resource&quot;&gt;Be a Resource&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be the always open, always ready and enthusiastic source of inspiration and encouragement, not the compliance department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you have to say YES to everything. But it does mean you need to be clear about why you’re saying no, and what the alternatives are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-the-worklife-role-model&quot;&gt;Be the Work/Life Role Model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing pisses off a team of people working like the heir-boss who shows up to work in his golf outfit. Don’t be that guy unless you really are inviting the work team to a round of golf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, be even more understanding that they have golf games, or kids to shuttle to work or take to the doctor. There is nothing like a work-leader who gets that his or her employees are people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the most important aspects of being a leader. Whether you’re the company president or a lowly and restricted manager, they will turn things around - and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone in a leadership position needs to consider all of these things carefully, but more importantly, you also need to be, at heart, a good person. And we assume you wouldn’t have read this far if you weren’t already a good person. So pat yourself on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Work Life Balance: Six Tips for ALL Your Employees</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-work-life-balance/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-07T01:25:14-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-work-life-balance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;_Achieving employee work life balance might seem like it’s a purely personal matter. But a little coaxing from management goes a long way too.  _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;six-management-tips-for-actually-achieving-employee-work-life-balance-in-this-lifetime&quot;&gt;Six Management Tips for Actually Achieving Employee Work Life Balance in this Lifetime!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee Work Life Balance is big issue for any company struggling to keep a big group of people productive and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s not just a work benefit and it’s not just a personal goal - something your employees do on the yoga mat. Building productivity for the long run is something every workplace needs to consider, and consider deeply. These six employee work life balance points are designed to get your workforce happy, adjusted and continually maintaining the balance that’s best for all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work on these employee work life balance points with your team leaders and have them worked on down to the least valuable employees. They’ll see the difference - and you will too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-goals&quot;&gt;1) Set Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-satisfaction/&quot;&gt;If you read this blog regularly, you’ll know that we talk about goals a lot.&lt;/a&gt; Your team leaders should be working with employees to understand the goals that they have determined themselves, and those can very well include personal - and outside of the office - goals too. Limits, achievements and dreams are all fair game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establish-rewards&quot;&gt;2) Establish Rewards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding goals also means achieving them, and extra reasons for doing so. Work with your teams so that rewards are understood, established and fairly administered. And remember, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_time&quot;&gt;flex-time&lt;/a&gt; and paid time off cost you virtually nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-time-wisely&quot;&gt;3) Manage Time Wisely&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we’re all about good time management. Talk to your team leaders about better managing their own time, and taking better account of workers’ time. Make sure that time requirements and time-off notice restrictions are clearly posted and all of the available software that’s designed just for the task is being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-it-personal&quot;&gt;4) Make it Personal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your employees want to be treated like adults&lt;/strong&gt; - especially the good ones. Freedom comes with responsibility, but your star performers are worth the risk. Make sure they understand consequences, and risks too. But letting them go now - letting them auto-manage and auto-decide and auto-progress -  has all kinds of ways of paying you back. So does understanding, talking about it, and talking about it with all your people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;train-where-necessary&quot;&gt;5) Train where necessary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we mentioned in our post on Employee Satisfaction that you need to be prepared for training. Achieving work life balance for your entire team, or your entire company, can take some serious re-allocation of resources.** Stress management can be vital if it turns into a big project, but what employee is going to not love their company after that?**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;radiate-positivity&quot;&gt;6) Radiate Positivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loving life and your job still starts with you.&lt;/strong&gt; Somehow, we think you’re up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t underestimate the key criticisms and complaints of your key players. Listen carefully and improve everything you can for each of them. Celebrate their time off the way that they do, maybe not in the off hours, but when they get back. Everything that contributes to their well-being also contributes to the well being of the organization as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you can also highlight the positive roles played in and around your workplace. Sometimes the dark clouds come up with the most insightful and brightest workplace tips. Pay attention to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of these are long time propositions - and they may take some time.&lt;/strong&gt; Workplace culture does sometimes meet stiff resistance, sometimes. You may be pleasantly surprised how quickly and efficiently people take to balance - and learn to love it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Satisfaction: Getting There Was Easy</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-satisfaction/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-30T00:38:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-satisfaction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/employee-engagement2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/employee-engagement2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;engaging employees&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;_Employee Satisfaction can be measured in lots of ways. These Five quick easy steps can help you to do it and to see the results, working for you.
_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-satisfaction-through-empowered-employees&quot;&gt;Employee Satisfaction through Empowered Employees:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five-ways-to-give-your-people-the-power-to-make-themselves-happy-at-work&quot;&gt;Five Ways to Give Your People the Power to Make Themselves Happy at Work.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Employee satisfaction can take a lot of different forms. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can also take a load off your shoulders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But taking responsibility, engaging with the job at hand and moving on every day to something newer and brighter and better is part of YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, all of us sometimes have to deal with dinosaur management environments - and a few dinosaurs, too.  We can’t always change things as fast as we’d like, but we can present a better, smarter and more profitable business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee satisfaction is front and center in that business model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied employees are empowered, autonomous and able to take full responsibility for their work. Their development and performance are also key to that satisfaction. They’re working in a continual process of improving themselves. They’ll make their own decisions, argue for their efficacy and they’ll do it from early in the morning until late at night. Accountability is everything - and they know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, you get better customer results and more productivity while relying on the true leaders that you’re helping to create. And leaders need to actually feel the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the five things you can do to increase employee satisfaction&lt;/strong&gt; by building an autonomous and self-directed workforce - and while watching your turn-over numbers drop. Empower everyone, and make sure management gets a good dose of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;insist-upon-goals&quot;&gt;1) Insist upon Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** Not your goals. Their Goals. **Make your employees write their own goals up and submit them. Work with them, or instruct management to work with employees, to understand their priorities and to coordinate them with the larger organization’s goals. But making your people a part of the organization makes them accountable within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-directed-development-and-learning&quot;&gt;2) Self-Directed Development and Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same thing. Insist on employee-drafted plans for education and training.&lt;/strong&gt; You can give them outlines, but not specific courses or plans. Let them base what they’re going to do on their own learning styles, study habits and success rates. Make sure the organization is willing to put budget or hours or space and if limits need to be in place, put them there. Again, make sure managers understand and have a voice in reviewing and directing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employee-auto-evaluation&quot;&gt;3) Employee Auto-Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of employees know that they are better qualified to evaluate themselves than anyone else - so let them do it. Employee satisfaction comes from having true responsibility for success, achievement and progress. Strengths and weaknesses and areas for improvement never stand out like they do when you’re assessing yourself. And many performance indicators will come as an enlightening surprise to management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;now-let-employees-evaluate-management&quot;&gt;4) Now Let Employees Evaluate Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to grow some backbone managers. Nothing is more satisfying to employees than righting true wrongs. And both parties need to see to the success of the other.  Be sure that the dialogue is safe, secure and as anonymous as it needs to be. Truly valuable but unpopular managers may be costing you more than they’re contributing. And employee satisfaction means a regular fair review of management. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transparency&quot;&gt;5) Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency can mean continual feedback moving in both (or all) directions simultaneously. That doesn’t need to be a buzz-saw environment of mutual destruction. Evaluating performance at every level will ultimately increase accountability and autonomy - but it does wonders for employee satisfaction too. Set it up. Get employees to see how and why others are perceiving their own activities this way and make sure that they can have an affect on others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately a team with a high level of employee satisfaction is going to be a far more competitive and cost-efficient team.  Empowering more people in your organization doesn’t mean giving up power, it means working in a smarter, more focused and professional atmosphere and the rewards are everyone’s to share and celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Staff Training for Workplace Success</title>
   <link href="/blog/workplace-success/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-23T00:16:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/workplace-success</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Workplace-Success1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Workplace-Success1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Workplace-Success&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Workplace success doesn’t take expensive software and endless training conferences. It just takes some attitude adjustments and some love for what you do. Here’s how to combine them in your workplace. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workplace-success&quot;&gt;Workplace Success:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ten-points-to-encourage-every-worker-in-your-shop&quot;&gt;Ten Points to Encourage Every Worker in Your Shop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is designed to give you the basics for a fun introductory or mid-season training conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need to be endless, or even much more than an hour, but it does help you to establish priorities and set some standards for your people. All of your people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what they need to know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;1) Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You take it seriously. So should they.&lt;/strong&gt; As of today, you need to hear what bothers them. Throw out the old, ugly art and bring in the new. It’s important. And it keep people happy. That’s just the beginning. It’s their environment too. Let’s make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organization&quot;&gt;2) Organization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the official hierarchy? Why? How long has it been that way? Understand the aims, structure and purpose of the entire organization. That gives everyone a more confident and positive place to be (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;values&quot;&gt;3) Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;we’ve touched on Core Corporate Values in other posts&lt;/a&gt;, there’s still work to be done. Make sure everyone understands how you arrived at the core values and try to build enthusiasm around each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ethics&quot;&gt;4) Ethics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every company has to face issues of right and wrong. But slacking off and avoiding the tough jobs costs money. Good work ethics are cultivated and highlighting the best workplace behaviors is a good place to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organize&quot;&gt;5) Organize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We said “Organization” above, but spend some time on how each of your employees can organize or optimize their own workplace. Point out &lt;strong&gt;“best practices”&lt;/strong&gt; and keep them in peoples’ minds - for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creativity&quot;&gt;6) Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is, ultimately, one of the most important. Highlight the true creatives - problem solvers, hands in the air types - who ever has really thought through completing tasks more efficiently, with better results or corrections. Everything counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stress-management&quot;&gt;7) Stress Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just pointing out that the organization knows about stress is a huge plus. It’s a terrific way to get your employees on your side. Some techniques for coping - and some best-practices - are in order too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-taking-work-home&quot;&gt;8) No Taking Work Home!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very good policy to enforce. Take a stand for work-life balance and your better people will be devoted to you. Again it’s just a matter of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attitude&quot;&gt;9) Attitude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one can seem tough. It helps to go back to the values mentioned above, but if you haven’t convinced the higher ups to go all in for a values-centered organization plan, don’t worry. Instead, just crack a smile on the faces of even your most cynical players. That can lead to a big learning moment - for everyone! Mentioning attitude is also a great opportunity to highlight the creative, the ethical and the hard-working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;respect&quot;&gt;10) Respect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We almost wrote “Getting Along” but this isn’t the moment to force everyone to hug people they don’t like.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather, use it as a moment to reinforce that one of your core values - however it’s written - emphasizes common purpose with all customers, employees, and whoever else you can think of at the moment. It can include suppliers or delivery people and even the people cleaning the workspace. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone deserves respect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workplace success depends on all of the above, and for all of your people. Maybe most importantly,  &lt;strong&gt;just mentioning all of the above also has a positive effect&lt;/strong&gt; on your entire work crew from team leaders down to the newest employees.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Flexible Workplace Culture</title>
   <link href="/blog/flexible-workplace-culture/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-16T00:28:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flexible-workplace-culture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;_&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/flexible-workplace-culture1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/flexible-workplace-culture1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flexible workplace culture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Flexibility and Workplace Culture are working together to open up stodgy old offices and shop floors. Are they working for you? _&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-flexible-workplace-culture&quot;&gt;The Flexible Workplace Culture:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-you-get-out-of-it&quot;&gt;What can you get out of it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workplace Culture is an answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big one for retaining talent, improving engagement, morale and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in spite of all of the strategies and schemes of HR departments, having the right culture in place beats them all. Any organization that’s been around for a while, even three, four or five years, has a culture. And most of the organizations we speak with are considerably more mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing, altering or converting an established workplace culture might seem like a bigger task that you can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But personality, tone, atmosphere and attitude are not strict laws that need to be respected. You can change them, but you’ve got to work at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably know already who to avoid - and what situations and places will cause problems if they’re not avoid. More likely than not, everyone else in your workplace knows to avoid them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are just some of the negative aspects of an organic workplace culture and which usually stand out. If all of that negativity is the only thing defining your workplace culture, then you’ve got your work cut out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexibility-to-the-rescue&quot;&gt;Flexibility to the Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultures are changed - sometimes slowly - sometimes quickly - through a series of actions, interactions and directives consistently applied.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can do this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often, &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; becomes a part of a company’s work scheduling after a transfer of one management team to the next. Because we’re flexible - all of the features of flexible scheduling can be slowly introduced for just the right teams, departments or individual players. Working towards flexibility (and transparency) and away from rigidity (and secrecy) are important, but of course you can do it at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workplace culture is already flexible. Yours may seem like it’s not simply because no one is working at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we encourage companies that are in the process of changing, to let us ride along and make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages to doing so - being flexible - rewarding key players with more flexibility - are so far flung and interesting and effective, that we can’t help but get enthusiastic about them. That same enthusiasm seems to affect the people and cultures we’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing strategies to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; your culture is a lot easier when your culture is open, flexible and well understood. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-retention-and-engagement-basics/&quot;&gt;We’ve written in the past about making sure everyone knows exactly what you’re doing and why&lt;/a&gt;. But that is really just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-flexible-workplace-revolution&quot;&gt;The Flexible Workplace Revolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, the number of American workers demanding more workplace flexibility increases. Every year it moves up the scales of the most important workplace benefits being offered. And surveys indicate that a lack of flexibility is one of the most frequently sited reasons for leaving or considering leaving your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a talent management strategy, scheduling flexibility is among the most important of all workplace cultural factors. But there’s that word again. &lt;strong&gt;Culture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offering more flexibility  - in scheduling, in showing up, in deadlines and working hours - is a terrific introduction to a major change in the culture of your workplace.&lt;/strong&gt; American workers continually call for being treated like adults, for respect and for work-life balance. Acknowledging and encouraging those things as part of your new flexible workplace is what your culture can start to look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But like everything in a culture, you need to understand it from a bunch of different angles, make it work and make sure that the talent you’re interested in keeping knows and understands it too. It’s not high culture - it’s workplace culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger employees are leading in demands for nontraditional work schedules. But that’s not to say that older talent won’t be immensely happy by their new cultural environment. You will be too. Get your hands dirty and your people will help out too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Benefits: What's In It For You?</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-benefits/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-09T00:24:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-benefits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/employee-benefits.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee benefits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employee Benefits come down to practical, useful extras that cement your talent into place and keep them there. These are the ten most important, to all of your employees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-benefits-are-not-just-expensive-bells-and-whistles&quot;&gt;Employee Benefits are Not Just Expensive Bells and Whistles.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of Principals believe that employee benefits are a big-time expensive headache. **It’s a&lt;/strong&gt; ** minefield, and every step you take will cost the company tens of thousands more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in many cases, old expensive perks sit unused or underused, while much more effective incentives - that show your workers you value them - are practically free and unimaginably easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;employee-benefits-the-ten-essentials&quot;&gt;Employee Benefits: The Ten Essentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Engaged, Informed, Interested Management.&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine that. Employees flee whenever and where ever  Management is lousy. We’ve been to meetings where management could not care less about the company, the policies or the employees. Have you? Anyone directly supervising others needs to have a spectacular personal relationship with all of the employees they plan on retaining. They also need to be engaged and encouraging of the development of everyone under their charge. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;If you’re management isn’t going anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t expect your employees to be following along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Generous easy-to-use healthcare, for their entire family.&lt;/strong&gt; We won’t go into this one much, because it varies widely from state to state, and Obamacare will change the landscape a lot. Hopefully for the better. This one, anyway, we expect you’re probably already on-top of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Sick Days - with no oversight and no repercussions.&lt;/strong&gt; Good employees hate being sick and hate missing work. They also hate management that doesn’t openly realize and respect that. Set it up so that your people can call off and still be covered. NimbleSchedule lets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/communicate-instantly/&quot;&gt;your people cover each other as necessary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Flexible scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of the clients we work with set up flexible scheduling for advanced or senior employees. A few even make it - wisely - into a performance based reward. Reasonable, smart and effective flexible scheduling makes some companies into the magnets for talent that they want to be. But it’s only possible because of advanced scheduling software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) A telecommuting option.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, within reason, it’s a great way to hold onto people, costs next to nothing and keeps your people right where you want them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**6) Well Defined, Fair Paths to Advancement. **It helps to have roles clearly defined and a good organization chart in place. It also helps if employees feel like they have a fair chance at advancement, and that people aren’t advancing for the wrong reasons. Spell it out and base it on rewards and actual accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Training and development.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes we get the idea that training ought to be enforced so that you - management - will learn just how valuable people are. Then you’ll take employee retention a lot more seriously. Outside classes and in-house workshops don’t have to cost a fortune. Some memberships might be pricey, but they are probably a lot less than re-training star performers who left to get them elsewhere. Bottom line: you can not make unskilled employees care about their performance. You are far better off converting non-skilled workers into skilled employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; Freedom doesn’t have to mean undue risks and costly mistakes. Employees as “owner operators” and who sink or swim based solely on their own abilities is a very efficient way to run your shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No-Guilt Vacations.&lt;/strong&gt; If your people aren’t scheduling time off because the pace of work is too heavy and too intense, then you are doing something wrong.  Probably a lot of things. And your facing on-going walkouts and resignations. Make it easy. Make it expected. And make them share what they did or where they went when they get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Appreciation.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be acknowledgement, it can be announcements in the company newsletter. Unskilled workers couldn’t care less. &lt;strong&gt;Skilled workers expect you to see what they researched and studied on their own and applied to your bottom line.&lt;/strong&gt; If you can’t find it, or you’ve still got unskilled people jostling over territory, then you can expect more of the same turn-over, bad attitudes and spilled milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t cry over it. Get your act together.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Talent Retention Environment: 5 Easy Strategies</title>
   <link href="/blog/talent-retention-environment/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-02T00:26:22-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/talent-retention-environment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;talent-retentionhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201309talent-retentionjpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/talent-retention.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;talent retention&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;talent-retention&quot;&gt;Talent Retention:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-your-workplace-environment-working-for-your-business&quot;&gt;Is your Workplace Environment Working for Your Business?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting and keeping the best players in the business is not in your bottom line interest.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, it’s far less costly to keep people working than to run through endless cycles of hiring and losing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real money to be made will come in the form of** increased productivity and ongoing, excited, interested Employee Engagement!**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re burned out in the most lackluster call center - lost behind a shopping mall in the middle of nowhere - it does not matter. Increasing productivity and angagement is the only way to hold onto the employees that matter - and that could even ultimately save your business, should that be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-cultivating-and-maintaining-a-workplace-environment-that-keeps-your-star-performers-engaged-and-productive-is-easier-than-you-think&quot;&gt;Creating, cultivating and maintaining a workplace environment that keeps your star performers engaged and productive is easier than you think.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hire-the-best&quot;&gt;1) Hire the Best&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that probably sounds obvious enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire based on social skills, personalities and out-going behavior. &lt;strong&gt;Hire weird people when you can. &lt;/strong&gt; They’re almost always the most valuable. Reward attitudes and ideas. Reward people who fight for what they believe in, even if they’re cutting against the grain or their ideas can’t be immediately implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And really consider how their time is used or wasted by your scheduling requirements.
Use quality of the hire as your metric – not how fast or how cheap. Plan and execute a talent acquisition and retention strategy that hires the right person, not the available person. Dig for the right person, that person you can trust with your business. If it takes longer, it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;values&quot;&gt;2) Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we’re really harping!&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;not least because we’ve gone over this theme in the past.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value your people, but most important, make sure that they know that they are valued because you’re all together in a values-related enterprise. It’s an exchange. If your people make your company more valuable then you - the company - have a responsibility to make the employees more valuable in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reach-out-and-encourage-reaching-out&quot;&gt;3) Reach Out and Encourage Reaching Out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of your employees are the best in their fields.&lt;/strong&gt; They are already engaged with industry organizations, associations and training courses. Make sure that they know that you’re behind them and get behind them more. Learn from them, and encourage them to teach and share with others what they’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collaborate-on-everything&quot;&gt;4) Collaborate on Everything!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can mean physical changes to office lay-out or it can mean schedule changes that encourage talking and group breaks and group lunches. The important thing is that your star performers are engaged with &lt;strong&gt;- each other!&lt;/strong&gt;  And with the less than stellar performers. Challenging each other’s thinking, aesthetics, tastes, and ideas should be a top priority. And it shouldn’t cost more than what you are spending now. In fact, you will find that it costs less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hire-from-without&quot;&gt;5) Hire from Without!**&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the above, you should find that your star performers - your real talent - are playing up your environment. After all, it’s their environment. and people naturally want to take pride in their livelihood, in the place where they are spending their time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means, if you’ve got more talent singing the praises of your company, you should have a better referral and hiring system in place and working for you. Talk to and hire more of the people also engaged in your industry. They’ll not only keep your talent in place, but &lt;strong&gt;they’ll be building value for you too!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the end, these people should want to make a difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should be actively inspiring trust and respect both inside and outside of the office, the shop floor, the workshop - or even that dingy call center. &lt;strong&gt;Suddenly it’s looking like a terrific place to work, isn’t it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Employee Retention Plans You Can Use Right Now</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-retention-plans/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-26T00:51:36-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-retention-plans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-retention-planshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201308employee-retention-plans-001jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/employee-retention-plans-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee retention plans&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employee Retention Plans can seem expensive and complicated. These five are quick and go into place with hardly a moment’s hesitation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-retention-plans-may-seem-all-the-same&quot;&gt;Employee Retention Plans May Seem All the Same.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-these-5-quick-easy---and-different---fixes-to-keep-your-talent-happy&quot;&gt;Try these 5 Quick Easy - and Different - Fixes to Keep Your Talent Happy!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Employees don’t come from cookie cutters. **Keeping the best workers in place can’t always follow the same plan either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller companies who want to compete against bigger, richer competition shouldn’t (and often can’t) simply imitate their much bigger rivals. But a “unique, personalized culture” - though it may make executives want to cry - is simpler and easier to cultivate than it sounds at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t run from feeling like a small-company. Embrace it. Promote it. Develop it - as your best chance at really competing for talent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the rules and regulations that bigger organizations depend upon just aren’t necessary for smaller companies. &lt;strong&gt;That’s a distinct advantage when it comes to Employee Retention Plans.&lt;/strong&gt; You can compete better by offering more and better freedoms, room for growth and experimentation - and learning! And best of all - no competition will come close to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;define-your-core-values&quot;&gt;1) Define Your Core Values.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/define-core-values/&quot;&gt;See our previous post on Defining Core Values.&lt;/a&gt; Get some whacky new ideas in there and bang them around all your best people. Get people inspired that they are working for something bigger and better. &lt;strong&gt;Become a values-centered enterprise!&lt;/strong&gt; What are you now anyway? An old-fashioned money-making enterprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forget-years-of-service&quot;&gt;2) Forget Years of Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tie everything to productivity, engagement and business objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; Get your Employee Recognition tied to your Core Values and shine the light where it belongs. &lt;strong&gt;Is there something in the world that you and all of your employees hate?&lt;/strong&gt; Racism? Poverty? Ignorance? Then fight it! Take your company in the right direction and everyone on your team will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognize-success-and-recognize-often&quot;&gt;3) Recognize Success and Recognize Often&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual reviews are totally - grossly - inadequate at this stage of the game. You need to be engaged with what employees are doing once a week. Twice a month if you’re short-staffed, but that’s really at a minimum. Reinforcing behaviors with ongoing feedback and training would be the wave of the future - if it weren’t already happening now. &lt;strong&gt;Make sure every team leader knows and understands this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revise-your-organizational-hierarchy&quot;&gt;4) Revise your Organizational Hierarchy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make at least some of it “open to debate” and give your teams a voice in deciding the best way to organize workflow, decision making and procedure. Encourage interaction, teamwork and, yes, engagement. (You should have learned something about interacting with the entire organization by Defining Your Core Values, above.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/how-to-time-management-revolution/&quot;&gt;Organize more group breaks and group lunches&lt;/a&gt; and encourage the discussion of topics relevant to every corner of your business. If your employees feel that they don’t matter, that what they think doesn’t matter, and what they do and don’t do and succeed at doesn’t matter - then don’t cry a river when they walk out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reward-success&quot;&gt;5) Reward Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the part that sounds way more expensive than it actually is.&lt;/strong&gt; But top talent expect to be treated like people. Re-work your system of rewards so that top performers get the freedom they want. Flex-time, paid time-off, half-days and paid training and travel. It’s all going to make more sense (think about it) than bonuses and cash outlays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No employee retention plans in the world are going to fix everything overnight. &lt;/strong&gt;But a good one will be difficult to duplicate and copy in the other shop across town. The rewards are tremendous, and growth nearly limitless! Remember, your best employees are not only ready to help you out, but many of them are anxious to get going, too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Define Core Values for Your Employees and Your Customers</title>
   <link href="/blog/define-core-values/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-18T23:48:36-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/define-core-values</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/28.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;corporate values&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Define Corporate Values for your organization now, and you’ll live to see a mountain of benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-want-to-define-core-values-for-your-business---start-with-the-basics---and-then-include-absolutely-everyone&quot;&gt;If You want to Define Core Values For Your Business - Start with the Basics - and Then Include Absolutely Everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining core values&lt;/strong&gt;, and living by them, is more than just a statement of ethics. It’s like a statement of beliefs that adhere everyone to the basic principles of purpose, conduct, service and behavior. Without a core statement - like a lot of businesses - your organization is afloat on a sea of assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This becomes a project for HR in that it doesn’t make sense to rely exclusively on the vision of distant principles&lt;/strong&gt;, executives or stakeholders. In some business models, where the CEO really does know everyone personally, it can work, but for anything bigger, HR needs to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organization that can define a “sense of self” will work better, work together together and better understand its mission, and reason for being. The sense of higher purpose should - and will - pervade every corner of your work place and serve to remind all workers that there is something to be engaged in, something they’re working towards and something they’ll be getting rewarded for participating in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sketch of what it takes to start to &lt;strong&gt;define core values.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-committed&quot;&gt;1) Get Committed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be the toughest part, but you’ve got to understand - thoroughly - that your organization is based in a values proposition. You don’t know what they are yet, but you’ve got to lay the foundations, whether your organization is 50 years old or starting up right now. Many organizations beginning to undertake this process will announce it as a 4-6 month project, involve the entire company and use today’s technology to extend the process to as many employees as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-your-own-house-in-order&quot;&gt;2) Get Your Own House in Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personally.&lt;/strong&gt; To define core values for an organization isn’t going to matter a wit if you don’t have a clear idea of your own most important motivations, drives, and expectations. These are all big “why?” questions, so look into them, write it all down, discuss them with your trusted confidantes, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-managers-partners--team-leaders-to-do-the-same-thing&quot;&gt;3) Get Managers’, Partners’ &amp;amp; Team Leaders’ to Do the Same Thing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be done by email, or in a conference. Define core values for who you are and who you want to be. You can assist all of them in the process by explaining the project, and by using an online survey, Google Drive, or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;put-everything-together&quot;&gt;4) Put Everything Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, have everyone vote on all of the values, from the ridiculous and the absurd to the lofty and the far-reaching. &lt;strong&gt;You’ll be surprised - not only at how quickly crazy ideas go away - but also at how much they inform&lt;/strong&gt;, inspire and promote movement toward focused and really good ideas. Having all of your combined values in one place even for a short time will profoundly inform your entire organization and the thinking of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-key-decision-makers-test-values-against-standard-employees&quot;&gt;5) Have Key Decision Makers Test Values Against Standard Employees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which employees represent the organization and its values well and which do not? Make sure in this stage that all of the participants have as much freedom as possible to express themselves freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result should be a list, perhaps quite long, of core values of all the people participating. It can be displayed on your internal website, or better, set up as a poll so that further participants can vote to start narrowing it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;begin-testing-with-your-whole-organization&quot;&gt;6) Begin Testing with Your Whole Organization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step can take anywhere from a week to a few months, but the more people involved, the better it will be. You can use online surveys and blind replies, but again, the more people the more accurate and valuable the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ultimately, you want every employee to be able to represent and engage with these values. You may want to issue them as a statement or a press release, but we’ll get to that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A principled decision-making process&lt;/strong&gt; that’s evident to everyone with a stake in the organization from the entry-level on up. Demonstrated commitment to values needs to be evident in every relationship from customers and employees to partners and affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll return in another post to discuss the use of that newly defined core values statement and its presentation to both employees and customers. It won’t affect every single customer, but the service they receive from your employees &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; affect them, all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>4 Tips for Successful Employee Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-12T00:44:17-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-schedulinghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201308scheduling-picsjpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/scheduling-pics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Scheduling&quot; /&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-tips-for-employee-scheduling-that-will-make-a-true-difference-in-your-workplace&quot;&gt;Four Tips for Employee Scheduling that Will Make a True Difference in Your WorkPlace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when the Excel spreadsheet was a godsend to employee scheduling. Decades of paper, slide rule and pencil seemed to all come to a close in the span of a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Excel still has its place in the office, as do the pencil and the slide rule. Its just that employee scheduling has had to catch up with busy employees and business that have changed as much as workers have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;business-will-keep-on-changing&quot;&gt;Business will Keep On Changing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not a lot that you can count on. There is one definite. It will change and your employees will change and your need for having them, now or later, will change too. Full-time shifts, part-time shifts and probably some others will all all be in there, and many of them will ceasing permanent while others will increase in importance. Someone needs to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business is seasonal, affected by seasons, or changes from month to month, then employee scheduling is probably already far more complicated than it needs to be. It won’t   get less complicated, but handling all of that complication will get a lot easier. You just need to know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many employee scheduling projects are taken up just to let lesser skilled employees know that you’re looking out for them. They need advance notice of what’s going to happen and - frankly - you probably do too. But if week after week it’s taking longer and longer, or anything more than a few administrative minutes, it’s probably time to make some serious changes. That’s what this article is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communications&quot;&gt;1) Communications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We harp on communications as much as we do on everything else here, and it just can’t be over-emphasized. A lot of negative behavior lives on far longer than it should - in many dysfunctional workplaces - just because communications are neither open, productive, or well implemented. Understand employee lifestyles, work styles, preferences, needs and personalities. Talk to them, and even more important, listen to them. You’ll see who the leaders are  and just by getting to know them you’ll get to know what kinds of schedules they need, want and deserve. Employee scheduling conflicts have a way of dissipating when the communications channels are open and well tended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinate-all-schedules&quot;&gt;2) Coordinate ALL Schedules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just work schedules, but seasonal, production and delivery schedules need to be looked at too. These can often be available months in advance. Part-time, seasonal and flexible schedules are easier than ever to manage &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;with the right software&lt;/a&gt;. Adding extra-help - only when it’s necessary - is crucial, but you’ve got to be able to rely on a history and production and delivery schedules to know what’s going on, and as far in advance as possible. Peak seasons can wreak havoc on the demand for workers and can depending on all kinds of variables. That’s one of the reasons that &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; has on-the-fly messaging -  so that every employee who needs to know gets to know up to a week in advance - and sometimes more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plan-for-plan-b&quot;&gt;3) Plan for Plan B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternate Schedules should be easy. Employees need to know how to quickly replace themselves when they’ll miss a shift and they should be able to do so with long notice - at least a week - and with little notice. Oversight? Your software should be looking out for you and following up with employees. Still, a back up plan may be necessary if things really do get sticky. Part time or seasonal employees can be life savers in such situations and keeping some people on-call is increasingly popular with shift schedulers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revise-your-working-hours-policies&quot;&gt;4) Revise Your Working Hours Policies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While excusing tardiness or missed shifts is not the most common way of handling the problem, it does go on more than a lot of managers would want to believe. While flexible scheduling should not be used to reward truancy or otherwise careless employees, in most cases we’ve looked at, truly valuable employees are simply hampered by having to adhere to needlessly strict schedules. 9 to 5 is simply when everything in people’s lives gets done so working different, more flexible hours can often make all the sense in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we’ve become something of the experts in using employee scheduling to improve engagement, performance and productivity. There’s nothing quite like re-inventing your workplace by giving your people freedom and their lives back while still doing an excellent job and succeeding in your own market.

   <title>Employee Engagement and Employee Retention: Beyond the Basics</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-engagement-and-employee-retention/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-05T00:39:21-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/file000296584843.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Engagement and Employee Retention&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-engagement&quot;&gt;Employee Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-employee-retention&quot;&gt;and Employee Retention:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mastering-the-theory-and-putting-the-results-to-work&quot;&gt;Mastering the Theory and Putting the Results to Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;section-1&quot;&gt;_&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last time, we gave you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/employee-retention-and-engagement-basics/&quot;&gt;a crash course in Employee Engagement and Employee Retention basics.&lt;/a&gt;  We hope you’ve had some success in getting some of these new ideas out to your key management personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we’re going to up the ante with some steps you can start implementing right away - once you get the basic understanding that employee engagement and employee retention really are two sides of the same coin. Engaged employees are not nearly so likely to walk out the door, but keeping them takes some understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding onto talent is like plugging a hole in the bottom of your bank account. The loss of talent, experience, company-specific skill-sets - and whatever you put into training - &lt;strong&gt;is increasingly quantifiable&lt;/strong&gt;, and at this stage you probably don’t even want to look at the numbers. We’ll look at them in a subsequent post, but for now let’s look at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-some-teeth-into-your-employee-engagement-and-employee-retention-initiatives&quot;&gt;Putting some Teeth into Your Employee Engagement and Employee Retention Initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Basics for employee engagement and employee retention&lt;/strong&gt; were just that; a simple explanation so that you get the idea. There are companies - yes, even big successful companies - who’ve lost millions on ineffective implementations and incomplete campaigns. &lt;strong&gt;Both policies and proactive practices need to be in place, understood far and wide and continually tweaked, updated and perfected.&lt;/strong&gt; Following are some of the most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recruitment--hiring&quot;&gt;Recruitment &amp;amp; Hiring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised how many companies still simply post an ad in the paper for what they think they need and then hope for the best. Like in a lot of areas where much of the process has been outsourced, companies that keep their recruitment and hiring in-house are still learning a lot from the agencies. Even with no relationship, you simply must look at what the professional headhunters - and their agencies - are doing. Do not simply fill any position without fully understanding the implications and the potentials. To do so is simply to throw good money after bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compensation--benefits&quot;&gt;Compensation &amp;amp; Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think you understand this. It’s among the most important ways to demonstrate your commitment to employees and strongly affects their willingness to stay or to be lured away. But seldom discussed and far too seldom implemented are generous changes to &lt;strong&gt;time-off policies, flexi-time and similar benefits&lt;/strong&gt; that cost next to nothing and that seriously enhance your competitiveness in your skills marketplace. &lt;strong&gt;Now think about these “Pie-in-the-Sky” benefits &lt;/strong&gt;(that cost next to nothing)&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * _ Paternity/Maternity Leave_
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * _On-site Child Care  _
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * _Tuition Reimbursement_
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * _Mandatory Sabbatical or Time-Off_
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * _Research or Development Trips, Studies and Conferences_
&amp;gt; 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wellness&quot;&gt;Wellness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a mouthful of soft word - and your star talent will probably be cynical about it too. At least at first. It doesn’t have to be a soft option, and very often, star talent are practicing some kind of “Wellness” regime, already - maybe in secret. It’s not a return to paternalism, but a realistic assessment of people and what people need. Support for healthy and well-balanced lifestyles might mean in-office yoga, but it might also mean some ergonomic exercises, reviewed by your health and legal staff and inserted into your internal newsletter. Diet, stress, fitness, mental health, safety and awareness all show employees that you’re engaged with them. &lt;strong&gt;You want engagement from them? Give some back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recognition&quot;&gt;Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awards, titles and those horrible plexiglass pyramids that clutter desks do not add up to much. Every employee is aware of the restrictions on monetary rewards, raises and compensation. But paying them to not be there, in recognition of what they’ve achieved is a tremendous bonus for every one of them. It might sound expensive at first, but you’re paying now for disengaged and listless employees who aren’t performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is really where you need to put your big-boy pants on. You want engaged employees? Then be prepared to take a serious look at how they want to run your company and to hear all of their ideas for running it - and managing it. Performance-based pay, outcome based incentives and recognition with time-off for achievement will all pay off big time, - if and only if - management is on the ball to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieve all of the above and you may well find yourself well rewarded. Take some time off and give some to your best performers too. Make sure everyone knows exactly how and why and where they’re going - and you’ll have no problem with employee engagement or employee retention.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-engagement-strategieshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201307employee-engagement-strategiespng&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Employee-Engagement-Strategies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Employee Engagement Strategies&quot; /&gt;___&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-retention-and-engagement-basics-for-the-management-team-thats-going-somewhere&quot;&gt;Employee Retention and Engagement Basics for the Management Team that’s Going Somewhere!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tips&quot;&gt;8 Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-building-employee-retention-and-engagement-basics-from-the-ground-up&quot;&gt;for Building Employee Retention and Engagement Basics from the Ground Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s run with it. Employee retention and engagement strategies come and go.&lt;/strong&gt; So do employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to get serious then take this - all of it - into consideration, and start putting as much into play in your workplace as you can. You’ll see the rewards in longer employee relationships and more meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-just-not-about-the-money&quot;&gt;1) It’s just not about the money.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few people get married for the money. Very few. Likewise, people accept jobs because they think they can do them and they think they can do them well. Workers expect their raises to be modest. But like their marriages, people’s jobs are measured in terms of comradery, security, and future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;every-employee-is-different&quot;&gt;2) Every Employee Is Different&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one has a homogeneous work force. Every work force is made up of people from crazy different backgrounds, educations and experiences. Understanding how to meet their needs and expectations — is a terrific way to learn to better put them to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expectations-need-to-be-managed-just-like-workers&quot;&gt;3) Expectations need to be Managed, Just Like Workers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific goals and benchmarks, written down, and posted, will make a world of difference. Any plan of action is better than none at all. Make an effort at transparency and let your teams no what’s in it for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;act-the-part&quot;&gt;4) Act the Part!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management doesn’t just need to look the part but to act it, all the time. Just like you can’t show up for work drunk, you can’t show up distracted, lazy, or listless. Your full engagement does wonders to inspire engagement in your team. Leadership is a 24 hour job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-your-word---and-give-it-often&quot;&gt;5) Keep Your Word - and Give It, Often.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t keep your promises - DON’T MAKE THEM. Any betrayal of confidence is going to cost you and your business. Regular communications need to highlight awareness and participation in problem solving, workplace issues and project success .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;map-out-the-future&quot;&gt;6) Map Out the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in a marriage, employees want to know where you’re going. And again - what’s in it for them. Have you got their back? Is what they’re investing in your company going to be rewarded with better opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embrace-challenge---and-reward-success&quot;&gt;7) Embrace Challenge - and Reward Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An engaged work force is one that’s always ready for challenge. Make more decision making a regular part of the challenge and make sure that ideas and feedback are going both ways. Your engagement with your workers’ ideas keeps the whole workplace focused, seriously on the established goals.  Rewards can be verbal, time off, flexibility, bus or commute incentives or even lunch, in or out of the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-acknowledging-strengths-and-not-weaknesses&quot;&gt;8) Focus on Acknowledging Strengths and Not Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you don’t need to ignore worker’s weaknesses. But by switching your focus to what they are doing right, you can shift the attention of the entire company or department to an area that supports the professional bond necessary to a long and fulfilling relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The How To Time Management Revolution</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/how-to-time-management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to time management&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-how-to-time-management-revolution-got-done&quot;&gt;The Real How To Time Management Revolution Got Done.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;were-you-paying-attention&quot;&gt;Were you paying attention?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;productivity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s everything to some of us, and practically nothing to a lot of the people we’re looking after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pity is, just by including some more of them in the conversation, productivity would easily become a priority for a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of the talk about new data - and especially “Big Data” - the real word on “innovation” is getting lost in the challenges of implementing and effectively gathering data. This is true in all kinds of areas, but especially true when it comes to time management and employee scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-time-management&quot;&gt;How To Time Management!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re calling the How to Time Management Revolution here,  but you could call it Can-Do Time Management too.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s really just a matter of setting things up, so that the data is coming in.  We’re not saying you absolutely need to track every aspect of every worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a brief trend to really spy on employees and what was learned is enough that most businesses don’t need to wade into the morass of “really spying” on employees. Sensor tracking that captured movements and interactions - and sometimes more - is invasive, cost prohibitive and doesn’t really have a benefit that is specific to every shape and size of business. But generalizing from what such studies have shown can have it’s pluses too, especially if you are already recording and tracking clock-ins and clock-outs and break times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;schedule-group-breaks&quot;&gt;Schedule Group Breaks!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group Breaks were shown, through all of those truly invasive studies, to be more beneficial to your productivity numbers. Groups of employees simply interact more, begin to work closer and increase productivity. Information sharing pays off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strong&gt;Nimbleschedule&lt;/strong&gt; can be programmed to signal or alert users to breaks, encouraging that kind of group face time is not only possible, it has real advantages that can start now. You should be able to control who is taking breaks when - and who they’re taking breaks with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we said above, including more of your team in on the overall productivity strategy will give you better results, even if you can’t get all your players to play together all of the time. Some of the time and some of the players is better than individual break times and internecine rivalries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More face-time with colleagues is a trackable outcome&lt;/strong&gt; that yields real productivity results - even in the short term. Structural changes to promote this kind of activity, including scheduled group breaks, meetings or mini-meetings, or brainstorms can and should be scheduled, automated and the outcomes analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-data-is-not-big-brother&quot;&gt;“Big Data” is Not “Big Brother”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, indoor GPS and location sensors can show you how physical facilities are being used, occupied, exploited or neglected. You can cut energy costs in some areas, and better occupy resources that are not fully being put to use. If employees are really isolating themselves, there may be good reasons or there may be simply changes to floor plans or departments that need to be looked at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every case, we encourage pushing as much strategic information as low down the in the chain of command as possible. Of course, you’ll make the ultimate decision. But you’ll also be surprised at how many more collaborators you have when you invite them to collaborate. Rather than secretly spying, share the strategy and ask them to be a part of the learning process. That’s the true How to in Time Management today!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Reduce Turnover without Losing Your Mind</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-to-reduce-turnover/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-14T01:02:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-to-reduce-turnover</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-refuce-turnoverhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201307staff-recognitionjpghow-to-reduce-turnover-and-still-keep-your-business-growing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/staff-recognition.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Refuce Turnover&quot; /&gt;How to Reduce Turnover and Still Keep Your Business Growing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning how to reduce turnover is one of those great un-sung learning processes that just not enough people ever begin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is, reducing staff turnover doesn’t just happen when you raise wages or hand out gifts and compliments. It just couldn’t be that simple so don’t even dream about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what industry you’re in, you’re probably not looking at the real problem. It just doesn’t come down to not enough money or not enough perks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Employees quit because the person supervising them is not well trained to keep them there. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like an over-simplification, keep reading. We think we’ll convince you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while most firms will meet and talk about how to solve the employee turnover problem, very few of them will directly confront the issue of training supervisors to properly keep them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-reduce-turnover-in-five-easy-steps&quot;&gt;“How to Reduce Turnover” in Five Easy Steps…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-meeting&quot;&gt;1) Have a Meeting.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, you’ve heard that one before. But get your entire staff in on the problem, and you’ve already gotten them in on the solution. Asking them for help is a way of making this a two way street. And their help contributing a little more helps make your staff into a company. They get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-it-together-yourself&quot;&gt;2) Keep It Together, Yourself!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing will un-inspire stressed and possibly over-worked employees like a boss who is losing it. Take time not just to thank employees but get to know more of them and inspire them. And you do need to look and act the part the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compliment-specific-tasks-not-the-job&quot;&gt;3) Compliment Specific Tasks, Not “the Job”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff members do need hear they’re doing a good job.  But not in the abstract. You’re not addressing the entire job, and thus letting the staff member know that they’re doing great can result in them feeling they can relax and take it easy. Motivating employees means pointing out exactly what was done correctly, point by point, and perhaps even approaching them with a list that can be shared with others. Staff members need to know precisely which behaviors will be rewarded and they need to be able to repeat them. It’s not really about good feelings, so much as about encouraging the right behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;look-after-the-underperformers&quot;&gt;4)  Look After the UnderPerformers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody loves a star. Except of course for those who aren’t shining quite so bright. While it makes sense to reward those who are truly out performing everyone else, you want to pay attention to the most discouraged and who are possibly already facing bigger challenges. If you can reward them for even minor improvements in performance the impact can be much greater than for those who’ve come to expect regular rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-there-when-it-matters&quot;&gt;5) Be There When It Matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formal job review is frankly too late. Catching your stars, or your less-than-stars, in the act of doing something good, or correct or right or beneficial is what matters. It matter to other member of a team, and it matters to each individual employee, too. Don’t leave it to chance that you’re going to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to what we were saying above. Are you the right person for this list? Are you sure your line supervisors are reading the same things that you are? If you’re not getting them onto the same page that your on, then your chances for success are seriously reduced. &lt;strong&gt;Share this article with all of them, and let us know how it goes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Importance of Human Resources Management: Trends & Technology</title>
   <link href="/blog/importance-of-human-resources-management/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-08T00:17:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/importance-of-human-resources-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;importance-of-human-resources-managementhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201307importance-of-human-resources-management-trends-and-technologyjpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/importance-of-human-resources-management-trends-and-technology.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;importance of human resources management&quot; /&gt;___&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-importance-of-human-resources-management-is-just-beginning-to-be-understood-the-latest-trends-and-technology-show-a-burgeoning-new-frontier-of-opportunity&quot;&gt;The Importance of Human Resources Management is Just Beginning to Be Understood;  The Latest Trends and Technology Show a Burgeoning New Frontier of Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR used to be a sort of support department, tagging along management and trying to keep up with the personnel changes and needs as they came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as technology redefines the industry, the importance of human resources management has leapt to the vanguard. Keeping your business profitable, and on the cutting edge is not just about the technology you’re using, selling and buying. It’s also about keeping key performers working with you, keeping them happy, and learning from how they do what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger and mid-sized companies are already learning to learn.&lt;/strong&gt; They ‘re tracking, analyzing and tweaking all kinds of performance numbers, and the numbers that come back are always more interesting. The importance of human resources management data, analytics and numbers are among the most interesting of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Data, Mobile and the move to the Cloud are a part of it - but by now, that’s all pretty much old-hat. Last year’s trends are established, standard operating procedure now. But how they’re affecting human resources management is among the most interesting developments across the business landscape of the last year - or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mobile has interrupted the workplace and the over all technology landscape, so too it continues to interrupt the normal way of managing personnel. But just as GPS allowed fleet managers to better monitor drivers and vehicles, so a range of devices and chips and cards are helping HR to better collect data and use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the most important developments to keep in mind as your assessing the importance of human resources management in your own organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ongoing-training-support--staff-development&quot;&gt;Ongoing Training, Support &amp;amp; Staff Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised how much employees love the chance to better themselves, on-the-job, and while everyone else is working. Eclasses, video and conference room lectures and training make it affordable and easy. With automated class and course scheduling, and attendance checking, it’s easy to see who’s doing what, when and where. And you bet your staff will love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;smart-badges-and-id-cards&quot;&gt;Smart Badges and ID Cards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth, RFID and similar broadcasting technology pairs up easily with your calendar or time clocking software and makes data collection easy and increasingly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complex-locations-management&quot;&gt;Complex Locations Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one stems from the GPS systems mentioned above, but multiple locations enterprises are actually buying back franchises that simply couldn’t be managed before. Today’s technology allows multi-state and regional operations to effectively keep an eye on all kinds of people doing all kinds of tasks, all from the same interface and in real time. Now imagine trying to do that over the telephone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internal-email-marketing&quot;&gt;Internal Email Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as companies are learning B2C communications - primarily from more successful B2B operations - they’re also learning to better communicate with employees. And they’re using mobile apps,  text messages and calendar software to do it. Task assignments, shift changes, and job specifications are all going out, tracked and turned around. Location assignments that used to be a lot more complicated are easy and even appreciated by pressured employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compliance-easing&quot;&gt;Compliance Easing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated and management generated break, vacation and and other reminders are a lot easier. They can out employee acknowledgement into black and white and let all kinds of companies avoid labor law disputes, while applying the same marketing-influenced “soft touch” to even bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about your own experience with human resources management and all the new developments unfolding now? Did we miss something above? &lt;/strong&gt; Let us know in the comments and we’ll keep you posted on the next steps to optimizing your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Short Staffing vs. Safe Staffing: Tips for Handling Both Situations</title>
   <link href="/blog/short-staffing-safe-staffing/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-01T00:53:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/short-staffing-safe-staffing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/short-staffing-tips.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;short staffing tips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;short-staffing-should-not-mean-short-service-no-matter-what-industry-youre-in&quot;&gt;Short Staffing Should Not Mean Short Service, No Matter What Industry You’re In&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We regularly promise customers relief for some of their short staffing issues. We’re happy to do so, but, in industries like Nursing, with it’s chronic shortages -  or Call Centers with super-high turnover, we can’t promise a panacea. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may still find yourself facing the shift, the night or the busiest morning without all the personnel you need. Short staffing is a problem in all kinds of industries, but it shouldn’t affect the safe operation of your business, ward, hospital or where ever it is you’re staffing people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in minimum safe staffing laws like those in California, and you may just find yourself in deep trouble. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some fast tips for surviving a short staffing crunch, while planning to reduce the likelihood of another and holding onto the staff you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-a-team-together&quot;&gt;1) Get a Team Together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any team can better handle any job. Make sure the burden of the missing staff is shared and spread out across the team. Prioritize tasks with all team members and encourage all of them to participate in that process. That way you’re reducing the impact and, as a group, working on minimizing the impact on anyone person. The emotional support is crucial in what can end up being a very stressful shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establish-a-truly-supportive-environment&quot;&gt;2) Establish a Truly Supportive Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hospital or healthcare settings where Safe Staffing levels really must be maintained, this can be key. A supportive environment can mean something as simple as open communication channels, but it can also mean partnering all of your staff so that those with the most responsibility really are not working on their own. You may need to get creative, find out what people need, and you may need to discover what would really make them “feel better” but don’t underestimate the good that can come from making people feel a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-better-use-of-your-unlicensed-and-support-staff&quot;&gt;3) Make Better Use of Your Unlicensed and Support Staff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hospital settings, there are limits on what tasks unlicensed personnel can perform. But like manager, many nurses just prefer not to delegate. Unlicensed staff should be a key subject of that team meeting above. But in many cases, licensed staff can be encouraged to make better use of the surrounding staff, but they often need to learn how to do it in a quick meeting with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prioritize---and-communicate-priorities&quot;&gt;4) Prioritize - and Communicate Priorities!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve mentioned it already, but it bears emphasis.  Priorities need to be established, explained - maybe argued over - and agreed upon. They then very likely need to be communicated to people up and down the chain of command. Establish a “traffic person” to make sure that all key personnel agree to those priorities or at least that they see how you’ve established them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting adequate staffing is probably some thing already on the discussion table. We’ve written in the past about tackling short staffing with flexible and more voluntary scheduling - but obviously, there’s no cookie cutter solution that’s going to solve everything for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-let-short-staffing-turn-into-a-chronic-problem&quot;&gt;5) Don’t Let Short Staffing Turn into A Chronic Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure that HR and people above you see the contingency plans your putting into place and what you’re doing to minimize the impact of the short staffing on operations. Stress points need to be pointed out and - going back to that list of priorities - the most important priorities may also need to be understood and explained and mulled over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re big believers in flexible, alternative and voluntary scheduling and staffing, they won’t solve every crisis or true industry-wide shortage. A good schedule is only as good as the planning that goes into it, but that plan can also be an important part of a staff retention plan.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Work Life Balance Takes Precedence Over Even Money</title>
   <link href="/blog/work-life-balance/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-27T00:11:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/work-life-balance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-life-balancehttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201305work-life-balancejpgwork-life-balance-is-increasingly-important-to-every-employee&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/work-life-balance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;work life balance&quot; /&gt;Work Life Balance is increasingly important to every employee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;simple-tips-every-employer-can-use-to-further-work-life-balance---and-job-satisfaction---for-every-employee&quot;&gt;8 simple tips every employer can use to further work life balance - and Job Satisfaction - for every employee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next generation of workers is willing to give up even substantial increases in pay for more flexibility and “balance” in their professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they feel appreciated, if they’re part of a team that sticks together and enjoy even a little more flexibility over their hours and place of work then they’re likely to stay.  Previous generations - who you may very well also be employing - wanted development opportunities. And opportunities for advancement, security, certainty and a level playing field - all admirable goals for the work place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Generation Y and millennial workers will even accept less money - lower pay - in exchange for more control over how when and where they’re going to be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining the talent your company needs - today more than ever before - means changing your work more into a thing and less into a place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are eight strategies to bring up at your next HR retention meeting. Everyone of them will keep those younger and more restless employees happy, but they also work with older generations too. By 2020, you’ll be looking at 50% of your workforce being made up entirely of Generation y, so there’s no time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-your-policies-clear&quot;&gt;1. Make your Policies Clear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies on flextime, telecommuting and performance need to be clear and known far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reward-performance&quot;&gt;2. Reward Performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no saying that every employee needs to start out as the free bird. Build increasing freedom into your policies and let the best people reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;3. Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they need networks, the time is now to get them out the office. This can be the greatest expense for companies moving into the cloud, so now is the time to start planning for secure and always available cloud-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choice&quot;&gt;4. Choice&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees like to be able to say no. No guilt, and no worries make even die-hard desk jockies into true believers. Give them the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;respect&quot;&gt;5. Respect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure employees know that you respect the decisions they make, and give them more choices where ever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications&quot;&gt;6. Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balanced workplaces need to put more effort into that internal newsletter or blog. It’s not just about the bottom line. It’s also about people, and people’s lives, accomplishments and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-personal&quot;&gt;7. Get Personal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**With all of the above in mind - **your new workplace has room for a little breathing, a little more fun and some messy personal lives. Of course, employees still need privacy and respect, but there’s a lot to be said for personal achievement, and kids’ achievements and your local schools, softball teams and scouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;test-review-and-modify&quot;&gt;8. Test, Review and Modify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your infrastructure learns to grow and change and improve, it’s not going to grow more rigid.  There’s no reason you should let it. Take the time to learn to read the new numbers as they are coming in. You’ll see performance increases, but you’ll be identifying problem areas too. Change and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That process will never cease, and there’s no reason it should. You’ll find that achieving balance is not only the most cost effective goal for your employees but for your entire organization too!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Payroll and Operations Parity</title>
   <link href="/blog/payroll-and-operations-parity/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-20T00:03:50-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/payroll-and-operations-parity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/payroll-operations-parity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;payroll operations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;payroll-and-operations-parity-is-not-only-reachable---its-coming-from-the-payroll-side&quot;&gt;Payroll and Operations Parity is Not Only Reachable - It’s Coming From the Payroll Side!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encounters-between-payroll-and-operations-have-been-limited-historically-to-something-like-no-you-cannot-have-budget-for-anyone-else&quot;&gt;Encounters between payroll and operations have been limited historically to something like “No you cannot have budget for anyone else.”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-that-as-they-say-is-a-thing-of-the-past&quot;&gt;But that, as they say, is a thing of the past.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As knowledge necessary to run a payroll department has increased - so has payrolls reliance upon operations - and IT in particular. Professionals running advanced accounting for commission schemes and scheduling calendars simply couldn’t stop learning as both industries grew and changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salaries, commissions, withholding taxes, wages, stock options, pensions, bonuses, policies, garnishments and benefits all continue to change and the software necessary to manage them does too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global or even simple multinational payroll can make the whole thing seem that much more daunting. Data privacy laws and tax disclosures and all the related regulations should be enough to start to give those of us in other industries an idea of just how complex these accountants professional lives have become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;payroll-data-for-operations-intelligence&quot;&gt;Payroll Data for Operations Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as all of that data gets collected and used for one purpose, companies are finding that the same data can be enlightening in all kinds of other areas - namely in operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate processing - so that everyone gets what’s coming to them - is just the beginning of what you should expect. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money paid for labor is - to put it lightly - combed over - meticulously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what that money bought is only slowly coming to light. And it’s coming from the very same payroll sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What used to be simple job descriptions, are today dynamic analytical reports that are able to process exactly what every post has done, what every job title is good at and ultimate what were the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payroll data was always the hidden key to the truth about operations. But with today’s advanced analytics - and skilled analysis thereafter - what’s happening today is a revolution in operations intelligence. It’s a revolution that depends on both operations and payroll participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-genius-of-advanced-analytics&quot;&gt;The Genius of Advanced Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real advantage - not always understood by payroll managers themselves - is that in most cases advanced analytics can be drawn out from payroll data without violating payroll secrecy policies or privacy guideline. Most of the intelligence that operations needs remains rightfully anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That still should leave a wealth of data about performance, output and results that good data people will put to the use of operations managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is doing what, for how long and when - and ultimately then,…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** The question is not how much did that person cost, but how much did that person earn?**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve shown above, Payroll data is already complicated. Working with such data requires an advanced degree, rigorous training and experience, and ongoing training, learning and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most important pieces of closing advice&lt;/strong&gt; is that you include payroll managers - with these kinds of advanced training and experience - early on - in all of your discussions and plans for operations improvement. The data they possess, or should possess, will be a invaluable asset for any organization to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Disagree? Please let us know all of your own experience with payroll and operations cooperation in the space below. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carlsbad, Calif.&lt;/strong&gt; Carlsbad based workforce management software developer NimbleSchedule announced the integration of their NimbleSchedule.com platform with BambooHR’s web-based Human Resource Information System (HRIS). The integration allows clients of both companies to interact seamlessly between the NimbleSchedule.com and BambooHR.com solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/peter.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/peter-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Many of our NimbleSchedule customers were already using BambooHR for their HRIS so it was a logical connection for us to make,” said Peter Swaniker, founder and chief executive of NimbleSoftware Systems. “Now our time and attendance functions can interact directly with BambooHR’s cloud-based solutions with no extra steps on the part of the user.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of the two systems was completed earlier this month, and allows clients to access services across the two platforms from either the NimbleSchedule or BambooHR portals. Both companies aimed their efforts at minimizing the time that small- and medium-sized businesses spend managing human resource-related issues, like time and attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to make business easier,” said Ben Peterson, BambooHR’s chief executive. “We live in an age when business should not have to choose between quality analytics and flexibility. Cloud-based services, like BambooHR and NimbleSchedule, give growing companies the quality and control they want with the flexible options they need.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Revenue from Outsourcing!</title>
   <link href="/blog/new-revenue-from-outsourcing/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-13T00:59:14-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/new-revenue-from-outsourcing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-revenue-from-outsourcing-is-not-just-your-grandmums-plan-for-cutting-labor-costs-its-a-business-model-for-growth&quot;&gt; New Revenue from Outsourcing is Not Just Your Grandmum’s Plan for Cutting Labor Costs, It’s a Business Model for Growth!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/outsourcing-strategy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;strategies for outsourcing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reasons companies outsource projects or entire departments usually look something like the list below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the new revenue from outsourcing model is not only significant, it’s changing the way that HR Managers and operations people think about labor - and the markets they’re currently serving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to show you that this current “reasons for outsourcing” list - that lots of hiring managers know and understand - will need to be radically updated, and in the near future. But let’s look at what you’re probably thinking - first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 - Operational and labor cost savings&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the big one, that used to be a real no-brainer. As we’ve shown in the past, the no-brainers are very often the places where you can find revolutionary thinking and ideas, if you just give them some thought - but let’s come back to that idea.
&lt;strong&gt;2 - Focus on core competency&lt;/strong&gt; - or core business focus, whatever you want to call it. The core of your business may not be expensive IT services or running a call center, so why are you doing it?
&lt;strong&gt;3 - Delegating!&lt;/strong&gt; - Difficult and complex functions are sometimes necessary, but do you need to do them in house?
&lt;strong&gt;4 - Mitigate Risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Maybe your local labor market is too unstable, or too expensive? A far less expensive offshore installation will let you carry on without carrying quite the same risk.
&lt;strong&gt;5 - Free up internal resources&lt;/strong&gt; - again - for that core business focus - and while tapping into far better expertise than you necessarily want to employ yourself.
&lt;strong&gt;6 -&lt;/strong&gt; Along the same lines - &lt;strong&gt;gaining access to a truly global knowledge base and skills pool&lt;/strong&gt; can have real advantages too.
&lt;strong&gt;7 - Leverage capital&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s also possible to leverage a fund for better profits for the company, and often this can only be possible by outsourcing or offshoring.
&lt;strong&gt;8 - Access new markets&lt;/strong&gt; - is very often only possible because of a company’s ability to offshore first and then, learning all the while, to expand into their new host market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing new languages, business cultures, regulatory environments and time zones is not something a company will learn to do in a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-revenue-is-everything-really&quot;&gt;New Revenue is Everything. Really.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, those are all the things we assume you already think about Outsourcing. But the paradigm is shifting quickly and that last point - &lt;strong&gt;Access to New Markets&lt;/strong&gt; - is soon going to be wither moving way up the list, or replacing much of the list altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, all decisions used to be based on cost. True,  quality and delivery frequently entered into the equation, but revenue opportunity is simply too big of an elephant in the room for lots of medium and bigger companies to want to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re old one-size-approach to everything simply isn’t going to cut it much longer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both HR and Operations can gain competitive advantage strictly through developing a workforce that is optimized and working well. No matter where they are, too. Mastering a distributed workforce model, in different and better markets - through well-implemented management plans - will mean that your outsourcing is always rolling you out to a better opportunity.  Imagine using all of your outsourced employees as pre-employees in a market you’ve yet to enter into. If you’re only trying to cut costs to service a mature market, you’re still only cutting costs to serve  market-share that is guaranteed to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experienced HR professionals, and their partners on the operations side can take a serious leap into a new revenue stream, without risking the roof. And of course, you’re current multiple locations just make the whole project seem like something you’ve already done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well implemented management plans - scalable software that grows with you - and strategic selection of outsourcing and offshoring partners are all part of the New Revenue Model for outsourcing. Take advantage of all of them. We’ll help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Implications of 24/7 Operations for Smaller Businesses</title>
   <link href="/blog/24-7-operations/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-29T01:03:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/24-7-operations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;operationshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads20130424-7-operations-001jpg247-operations-are-not-for-every-business&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/24-7-operations-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;24 7 operations&quot; /&gt;24/7 Operations are Not for Every Business.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-they-for-you&quot;&gt;Are they for you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot’s of smaller businesses and retail operations ponder longer and longer hours. Eventually they come around to wondering about just staying open all night and never closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24/7 operations will work for some businesses&lt;/strong&gt; in some locations, but not for all of them. Here’s what you need to consider before pulling another all-nighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The primary 24/7 operations problem is that income you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make is simply not as much as what it costs to stay open.&lt;/strong&gt; If the hours aren’t profitable then staying open is probably not your best business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some businesses will stay open only during the holiday season because they are busy restocking shelves anyway with a variety of other employees. Keeping a few more on is almost just the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other small businesses depend on their proximity to manufacturing centers, interstate highways or airports where round the clock service can give you a significant advantage over shuttered neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But retailers (mostly) keep doors open first and foremost to make a profit. Some others run round the clock to keep up with far-away customers in changing time zones. This is where shift work is common, important and difficult to keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staffing, operations and security costs all benefit from staffing schedules determined by demand at a given location. NimbleSchedule works with operators running multiple locations, often staffed by the same people, and for some very complicated scheduling needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work to help create realistic staffing schedules based on historical sales figures and traffic patterns so that when the store is open, is only when it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can mean 24/7 operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just as often, in looking at those metrics, it can also mean closing up shop for some quiet times when no one is coming in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those quiet times also lead to re-scheduling deliveries, or other service visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers numbers, revenue and even video surveillance tapes have all been used to determine if a 24/7 schedule is best for your operation.  Despite the loss of some late night customers, it may actually improve your bottom line to open up early and close when the customers go home. Saving on security staffing and double-teams can be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;8-hour shift don’t automatically mesh with a 24/7 operation. Scheduling employees around the clock usually wastes 3 days of work, every week, in downtime and squandered labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employees may also need HR support during off hours. Don’t leave them high and dry. That can also represent a significant cost in addition to your increased security and staffing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can also calculate - running forward&lt;/strong&gt; - all of your operations costs based on projected - and far more complex - scheduling needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, we can work with you to simplify those that are needlessly complex, and work with your business to schedule exactly the personnel you need - where you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule works well with complex, demanding and changing shift schedules&lt;/strong&gt; and the business that rely on them. If you’re considering a major shift scheduling change - to 24/7 operations - in all or some of your locations - or you’re thinking of simplifying everything, we’ll be happy to discuss the implications.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Workforce Optimization: 10 Easy Essentials</title>
   <link href="/blog/workforce-optimization/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-22T00:15:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/workforce-optimization</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/workforce-optimization-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;workforce optimization-&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workforce-optimization-takes-will-and-brains-but-this-is-how-you-get-started&quot;&gt;Workforce Optimization Takes Will and Brains, but This is How You Get Started!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce optimization can seem daunting.  &lt;/strong&gt; Cutting, tweaking, re-vamping and perfecting. It never ends and for lots of businesses - it never even begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But workforce optimization doesn’t have to be a revolutionary process or even one that interrupts your daily routine. At least, it needn’t interrupt you for long. Take these ten easy essentials to heart before you get going and you’ll see that little improvements add up quickly to big, big improvements and that will show up in all of your numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;talk-it-over&quot;&gt;1) Talk It Over&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can mean with team leaders or managers or with your entire staff, but we’ve found that more open, honest and thorough operations are also more efficient and better understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-misunderstandings&quot;&gt;2) Manage Misunderstandings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow up on meetings and discussions within a few days. Make sure that too much or too little work is handled quickly and early. You don’t need anyone affected to go too far without having their own concerns directly addressed. Make sure everyone is informed and gets a second chance to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-on-contingency&quot;&gt;3) Run on Contingency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiment with ever staff or department when there are absences or unexpected events. Set some up if you have to. Learn how tasks are handled - or where they are not handled - in the event that things go awry. Learn from the process and position appropriate staff to learn from it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refocus&quot;&gt;4) Refocus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get those same staff to understand the core business. They’re often in positions distant from the core of the business. Human Resources, for example, always benefits from a review and re-focus of priorities. Making sure everyone on the team understands the core focus of the business is essential to the bottom line and to everyone’s renewed determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reevaluate&quot;&gt;5) Reevaluate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to staff about family, skills, processes and preferences. Understanding their outside obligations is a huge way to improve trust. Does it tell you anything about internal processes? Keep profiles on file and review the information as you go. Make sure that staff know how and why you’re using this information.  They’ll appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measure-everything&quot;&gt;6) Measure Everything&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workloads, process times, delivery times, weekdays, weekends. Get an accurate picture of how long tasks take to perform. Understand how long it takes to load a truck, clean a hotel room, deal with a customer or assemble a boiler – without this knowledge, you’ll never be able to accurately align staff with demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimize-work-schedules&quot;&gt;7) Optimize Work Schedules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not just giving time off and flex-time. You’re also optimizing for heavy workloads and clearing the floor when things are quiet. Rewarding high earners and giving a break to those who’ve done their share is a great way to maximize moral and trust - and productivity too. Automating the system, tweaking the rules and learning how and when people work better is all part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consider-investments-carefully&quot;&gt;8) Consider Investments Carefully&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart phones, tablets and internet calendars are all part of the process. Your staff is using them and learning how and when they are using them is all part of the process. Come up with a social media policy that highlights your understanding and your willingness to integrate your workers’ lifestyles with your company’s mission. Make sure they understand it from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adjust-to-ongoing-revision&quot;&gt;9) Adjust to Ongoing Revision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where management often breaks down. Process tweaks get old and tired and routines settle back in. Get staff accustomed to continual optimization reviews and revisions. The perfect work schedule won’t settle everything, but will make them happy. In exchange for more productive and happy employees, you should be getting production analysts and optimization partners. Make sure they know about the new arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revise-and-improve&quot;&gt;10) Revise and Improve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reductions in labor costs and morale improvements can go a long way toward improving your bottom line. Don’t stop there. Get every employee involved in the process and make the process a part of your operation - a regular part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve got a better idea, please let us know in the comments section below. Your thoughts and experience are an invaluable part of the optimization process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Understanding Labor Costs - in Real Time</title>
   <link href="/blog/understanding-labor-costs/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-15T00:44:12-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/understanding-labor-costs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/payroll.png&quot; alt=&quot;payroll&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-labor-costs-takes-more-than-software&quot;&gt;Understanding Labor Costs takes More than Software!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of businesses use NimbleSchedule to plan workshifts and monthly schedules.&lt;/strong&gt; Lots more work with us to set up good flex-time schedules and keep workers happy while filling more human work shifts with more productive people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendance is up. Attendance may even be perfect. Hours go straight to payroll, seamlessly, flawlessly and with far fewer mix ups, less overtime and more productive hours to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-are-these-people-actually-doing-on-the-job&quot;&gt;But what are these people actually doing on the Job?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data are you’re actually collecting between those online, or smartphone, punch-ins and -outs is as important as your sales numbers or traditional profitability measures. In other words, what are you learning about what every single one of them is doing and how you might make it all better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tallying-up-tasks-pays-off&quot;&gt; Tallying Up Tasks Pays Off&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The productive activities you should be looking at might be these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tasks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campaigns&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pieces&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work orders&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equipment used&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job numbers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost anything with a measurable output could be listed, and counted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that still leaves you with what used to be called “overhead.” Administrative tasks, meetings, set-up time and training, maintenance, down-time; all of these things cost a lot and getting as much of them over to the “countable/quantifiable” side is always in your company’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measurement of “productive time” allows you to read the cost of a given job and every activity that you can count in a given shift or work period will let you know the time given to  tasks in terms of labor. Non-productive but still paid time is what very often has the biggest impact on your profit margin. Making less of it is not always an easy answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of your labor productivity and forecasting numbers are impacted by the cost of all of that overhead. Better tracking it and accounting for it is always in the interest of better accounting for costs. Make sure your payroll accountants - and all of your analysts - understand this when you get down to analyzing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-labor-costs-is-an-ongoing-part-of-your-operation&quot;&gt;Understanding Labor Costs is an Ongoing Part of Your Operation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning a monthly schedule is not the only way to get ahead. Shift manager and planners need to be reacting quickly to real-time situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce forecasting based on the detailed activities listed above&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to leverage teams of employees as they are needed. Any increase in conditions - like more customers, more phone calls or a successful campaign - need to be quickly accounted for. The systems you’re working with will provide insight into the status and resources available, but also to the people presently available. Managers are learning to optimize teams, work crews and productivity. They’re doing it by collecting and using the right data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information about activities, individual personnel and outcomes increasingly make up the days work of the labor force analyst. Data-capture needs to be efficient, un-intrusive and on-going. It is as easy as software, but it often needs to involve the workers being monitored. It can also help to have pride in the outcomes being produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badge swipes, barcodes and ID numbers are only as useful as the people who understand them.&lt;/strong&gt; That increasingly means allowing more and more users in on the analytical process.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Retail Schedules that Work</title>
   <link href="/blog/retail-schedules-that-work/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-08T01:04:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/retail-schedules-that-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;retail-schedules-that-workhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201304retail-schedulingjpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201304retail-schedulingjpgretail-schedules-that-work-shouldnt-require-more-time-just-more-smarts&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/retail-scheduling.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/retail-scheduling.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;retail schedules that work&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Retail Schedules that Work Shouldn’t Require more Time. Just More Smarts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing who you’re going to need and when is as important as knowing how much of inventory you’re going to need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all happening at the same, and very often, we talk to clients who spend no time on managing schedules, and have to blame employees when things don’t go well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-staffing leads to a waste of money but under-staffing loses you customer and sales. Being able to anticipate demand including labor demand is the name of the game in today’s competitive retail environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling breaks automatically and ensuring proper coverage at all times is increasingly left to automated systems that more accurately reflect both the needs and wishes of employees and cover the basics of your operation. For stores and chains with multiple outlets and sales environments, the retail schedules that work are those that are carefully constructed around a given set of rules, and the filled in by the employees themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retail-schedules-that-work-as-hard-as-you-do&quot;&gt;Retail Schedules that Work as Hard as You Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;points-to-consider-when-automating-your-retail-scheduling-process&quot;&gt;6 Points to Consider When Automating Your Retail Scheduling Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tracking and calibrating specific employee skills&lt;/strong&gt; is not only important, it’s vital to your overall work scheduling process. Openers, closers and floor managers, among other important roles make your operation smarter, and your scheduling should reflect that. The more of these key roles that can be spelled out, the quicker and better you get qualified people working in every area.
&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Getting control over promotions&lt;/strong&gt; and other event based tasks that come down from “on high” also needs to be a big part of your scheduling management. How you manage all the tasks necessary for a seasonal event or special should give you a good idea of how to handle any event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Managers need the tools to see that every task is executed across stores and in real time&lt;/strong&gt; and that sales or floor staff are occupied during non-peak hours. The better the communication between branches and headquarters, the better the trackable data that can improve the entire operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Don’t forget.&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to quickly cover unplanned absences with qualified personnel is vital, and comes up again and again. Qualified personnel actually appreciate the opportunity and the trust you place in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.Operations data helps all managers&lt;/strong&gt; to make more accurate decisions about who and how and where. Analyze all of it and work with a specialist if you’re not sure what you’re seeing. Managing on the fly often requires more mobile decisions and real-time date. Work with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Freedom for employees&lt;/strong&gt; can mean more choice, more flexibility and more irregular schedules. But that can all translate into happier more productive employees and better numbers all the way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you manage is up to you. We’re here to help, but these six points should be a good start for getting the process moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;payroll-time-managementhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201303payroll-time-managementjpgmaking-the-payroll-time-management-revolution-pay-off---for-you-and-your-business&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/payroll-time-management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Payroll Time Management&quot; /&gt;Making the Payroll Time Management Revolution Pay Off - For You and Your Business&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back offices are notoriously behind in automation, advanced technology and innovation. &lt;/strong&gt;Manual and semi-automated process creek along and many of your best people are probably leaning over spreadsheets and inking in information that should have been captured when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schedules need creating&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attendance sheets need updating&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They may even need to be remembered&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replacement staff need to be contacted or called&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing data needs to be filled in or re-filled in&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these seem like non-productive back-office tasks when you’re still eeking along, paying overtime and struggling to manage a payroll that can barely be followed, let alone analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But better data management doesn’t mean hiring a team of analysts and software specialists that come with an enterprise management software package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-payroll-time-management-solution&quot;&gt;The Payroll Time Management Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payroll is expensive. For most businesses it’s the number one cost of doing business and the first thing that needs to be covered in a monthly spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it so often the forgotten, rusty cog in the machine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what advanced payroll time management should be doing for you now:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickly and easily identifying scheduling conflicts - and resolving them&lt;/strong&gt; - allows the same managers to concentrate on productive, moneymaking activities&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking and monitoring employee working hours&lt;/strong&gt; allows those same managers to put the employees in the shifts that work best. You’ll be surprised how often an employee’s favorite shift works best for the company too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approving time-off requests and replacement workers from the field,&lt;/strong&gt; or from the cloud, unclutters your managers desk, and mentality and keeps the whole process transparent - and free flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating early or late time-card punching&lt;/strong&gt; and still having happier, more productive employees is not only possible, it’s the rule of the game!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-automated-back-office&quot;&gt;The Automated Back-Office&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automating more of your back-office procedure you’re able to provide - and enjoy -insight into your entire production line. You’re making the office jockeys in your HR or Payroll departments into full fledged management participants in the productivity process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better managed teams, squads, crews or departments are those managed now,&lt;/strong&gt; not based on last month’s information, but based on last month’s insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automating more and more of your back office you’re no longer searching for replacement workers or struggling to correct errors from an increasing array of loose paper elements. Time-off, next week or next month is built into the system and you set the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attendance tracking is no problem, but what about performance tracking?&lt;/strong&gt; Productivity tracking and optimal work conditions, hours, shifts or team leaders? All these factors that used to be &lt;em&gt;sort of imagined by managers&lt;/em&gt; can now be built into your system and established, used, tweaked and modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back office and payroll time management not only increases morale from the top to the bottom of your organization, but lays out a map so that you can easily analyze and actually see who are the most productive. You can see when was the most productive and you can recreate those conditions for every shift going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no time like right now to get the back part of your organization in line with the front. Getting even lackluster employees back in the game has never been easier or more worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Monitoring Employee Activity and Productivity</title>
   <link href="/blog/monitoring-employee-activity/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-25T00:59:16-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/monitoring-employee-activity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;monitoring-employee-activityhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201303flexible-contractingjpgmonitoring-employee-activity-and-productivity-doing-it-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/flexible-contracting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;monitoring employee activity&quot; /&gt;Monitoring Employee Activity and Productivity; Doing it Right&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring employee activity and productivity just keeps growing in importance as business everywhere realize they’ve already optimized every other aspect of the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the fact that workers are the last thing you’ve got, they’re also incredibly valuable and optimizing they’re work experience is not so much a process of squeezing the last dime out of them, but to the contrary, it’s a matter of making them happier and setting conditions so that they - happily - work better for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spelling out to employees exactly what and why you are monitoring is vital, not only from the point of view of trust and respect, but also for legal and contractual reasons. If you plan to seriously revise your monitoring and revision policies, you should be talking openly with both Human Resources and with Legal to determine and understand all of the implications. Fairness, business necessity, and compliance with labor laws and union contracts are just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues that do not impact your costs, reputation or productivity are, by necessity,  off-limits and need to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees need to be made aware of the monitoring that’s going on, understand why it’s in place and probably to agree to it. Private use of workstations during work hours as well as rules on the use of social media need to be spelled but that isn’t necessarily what we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;remember-employee-monitoring-is-not-a-negative-process&quot;&gt;Remember! Employee monitoring is NOT a Negative Process!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve actually seen overall productivity numbers jump simply because management spelled out rules for use of Facebook during working hours and encouraged employees to brag about where they work. Some companies have broadly eased recruitment drives and increased worker satisfaction that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important than what NOT to do, is the process of learning what to do. Spelling out the guidelines, the company’s position and that the company is looking to improve conditions and environment for all employees is the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-privacy&quot;&gt;What about Privacy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spelled out above that all employees DO have a right to privacy. If it doesn’t affect the company, then leave it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number one reason that monitoring employee activity grew the way that it did has to do with on-the-job safety.  Employee and customer/client safety issues are still the most important things to monitor, and in many cases, these kinds of issues are still the things being most heavily monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, safety will still trump privacy. But beyond particularly dangerous practices or equipment, there are still ways to improve your work place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;telephones&quot;&gt;Telephones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call monitoring can result in far better results across the organization. Beyond informing employees of what you are monitoring, it’s time to take a look at the performance of your best telephone people too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video-surveillance&quot;&gt;Video Surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video monitoring began out of concerns over safety, more than anything else. But video can and should be used to monitor the overall flow and feel of your workplace too. Look at who talks to who, from the point of view of productivity and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;computer--email-monitoring&quot;&gt;Computer &amp;amp; Email Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far more than simply learning what not to do, computer and email monitoring solutions allow employers to really understand how their best people are doing it. In some cases, you’ll find employees who have your message down far better than your marketing department does. You may even find some hidden truths that can be shared with all of your staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, far more than just catching the bad guys, today’s workplace monitoring is aimed at catching the good guys. Doing more of whatever they’re doing allows your entire operation to grow while your best performers lead the way!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Analytics for the Workplace: 5 Key Points for Analysis</title>
   <link href="/blog/analytics-for-the-workplace/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-18T01:34:28-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/analytics-for-the-workplace</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;analytics-for-the-workplacehttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201303workplace-analyticsjpganalytics-for-the-workplace---and-you&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/workplace-analytics.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;analytics for the workplace&quot; /&gt;Analytics for the Workplace - And You!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics in the Workplace is transforming the role of HR in many an organization.&lt;/strong&gt; Getting more done with fewer resources has gotten a lot easier, and that only been possible with the application of solid Analytics for the workplace. It may sound like just one more buzzword. We’re going to show you, and it’s quite a bit more than just a trendy topic. Better analyzing your people and their performance is done the same way that other people in your organization are analyzing cashflow, manufacturing, supply chain and finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining any (or all) transactional workforce data with business output data is today allowing HR to see where are the skills missing and where are the opportunities to do things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk a lot here about workforce and labor resources - and about making the most of them. There’s never been a better time to start gathering data on all of them. In fact, tactical and strategic decisions depend on the quality and quantity of data you can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytics for the Workplace allows for better managing teams, identifying and predicting trends and recognizing and encouraging employee engagement. One goal then is to coordinate an understanding of human capital with all of the financial capital and other business assets. That’s never been possible until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a correlation between engagement level and the simple number of days off scheduled by a key team leader? What about the role of flexi-time next to all of your other production numbers? What about a method for honoring and respecting the personal goals and outside responsibilities of your entire workforce? When that gets taken care of, then you have a very different organization to come into every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-analytics-to-examine&quot;&gt;5 Key Analytics to Examine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at what HR professionals are looking at today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are people working together?&lt;/strong&gt; Arguably more important than the quality of any given individual - engagement with a team lets HR know what what types of people are best able to make up a productive community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human capital?&lt;/strong&gt; Strategies for engaging and motivating employees beyond short term business goals are only understood through analytical approaches. They’re not just measurements. Value is actually created through engagement and organizations looking at the full range of demographic and sociographic factors are able to identify higher engaged employees and groups of employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership?&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine measuring leadership. Analyzing the issues important to leaders allow you to better understand and encourage the leadership necessary to all of your employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance?&lt;/strong&gt; What qualities can be identified in the employees who will perform well? Has someone ever held a leadership position? For how long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain?&lt;/strong&gt; From a human resources point of of view, this is a supply chain of human capital, and investing in it pay off. But take a close look at how and where and how much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human Resources departments are deploying and increasingly sophisticated array of data gathering devices to visualize and to analyze their organizations. Great visualizations allow engaged and more valuable employees to stand out and for managers and executives to spot them. They also allow them to identify and predict risks - and to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong visualizations of all of the above are just the latest, greatest way to understand your own workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Cloud Workforce: How and Why?</title>
   <link href="/blog/cloud-workforce/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-11T00:42:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/cloud-workforce</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cloud-workforce.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cloud workforce&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-cloud-workforce-management-has-taken-off&quot;&gt;5 Reasons cloud workforce management has taken off.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-youre-on-the-sidelines-you-may-very-well-be-wondering-why&quot;&gt;If you’re on the sidelines, you may very well be wondering why.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not just a fad or a passing phase,&lt;/strong&gt; but cloud-based workforce management tools and solutions are increasingly separating competitive enterprises from their landlocked former competitors. It should give you pause for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today everything from data backups to proprietary systems are being uploaded to offsite servers and staying there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure, software, networks and platforms are all delivered through the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at why it’s so important to your own competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost-effectiveness&quot;&gt;1. Cost Effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making any argument for an infrastructure or network upgrade just got a lot easier. The far more reasonable costs of cloud deployments nearly always bolster the argument for making the now much more moderate investment. While an onsite deployment used to command significant upfront investment, today’s cloud managers can improve the service they’re delivering eliminate or reduce reliance on on-site hardware and related maintenance and contingency systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maintenance--stability&quot;&gt;2. Maintenance &amp;amp; Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network and supporting applications for standard businesses processes all come to a stop when your server goes down or needs maintenance. In the past 20 years, many work places have gotten so used to downtime that they simply schedule it. Cloud-based solutions operate on a scale big enough that the inconvenience of system or server upgrades almost never affects users. Cloud based systems are far more stable. The latest version of almost anything is almost always instantly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;virtual-everything&quot;&gt;3. Virtual Everything&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is really not just a buzzword. Call centers and help desks and entire administrative teams now work, and provide service and support through the cloud and around the clock. A consist real time infrastructure that’s always up to date makes it all possible and, again, cost effective. Forecasting, scheduling, and implementation and delivery are all made more accurate and more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ease-of-use&quot;&gt;4. Ease of Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cloud itself would never have taken off if it weren’t ultimately easy to learn and easy to use. Demonstrating your ROI just wouldn’t happen with an expensive retraining or learning curve. Cloud-based solutions are adopted quickly and usually require no more than an online help file and an FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roll-out--delivery&quot;&gt;5. Roll Out &amp;amp; Delivery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation used to be the most painful part of any demanding software project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delays couldn’t be avoided and roll-out was done in stages just to learn how to do the roll out. Those days are over. Cloud based solutions usually just require the creation of an account, or at its most painful, multiple accounts. Solutions are rolled out in weeks or just days and sometimes in a single afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud workforce management solutions&lt;/strong&gt; are already as close as your G-mail account. Many of your employees are probably already using Google’s Drive to share documents or Google Calendar to plan meetings. That’s part of the reason that implementing a cloud workforce solution is easy; it’s already happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting cloud-based technology solutions will continue for these reasons and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re job is not only to understand why, but to observe how your workforce is already deploying cloud-based solutions and to see how you might take advantage of the opportunity they represent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Flexible Scheduling for Older Employees: Five Points to Make it Work</title>
   <link href="/blog/flexible-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2013-03-04T00:12:26-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flexible-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/flexible-scheduling.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flexible scheduling&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible scheduling for an older working population is more important than ever&lt;/strong&gt; as that part of the labor force continues to grow. They’re getting squeezed for time, even as they work later into life, but offering more in order to hold onto these golden oldies has never been more worth it to business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older employees offer the very embodiment of an  experienced, dedicated and stable workforce. They’re often more savvy, wiser on the phone and even reassuring to many a customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some estimates suggest that by 2020 - just seven years from now - some 36% of the US workforce will be over the age of 50. With different family concerns, different day-to-day scheduling needs and lots that’s just not on the regular business radar, flexible scheduling and ever-better workforce management mean that some employers will be able to make allowances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-scheduling-in-all-its-varieties&quot;&gt;Flexible Scheduling in all its Varieties!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider each of these commonly employed varieties of flexible scheduling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real flexi-time&lt;/strong&gt; - Within permitted parameters, employees simply have to meet minimum hours, at any time during any shift.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free shift swaps &lt;/strong&gt;- All employees have the freedom to drop or pick up shifts in consultation with other employees until all shifts are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staggered hours&lt;/strong&gt; - Usually to allow for longer opening hours, employees start and end shifts at different times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self rostering&lt;/strong&gt; - Workers can simply sign up for shifts within parameters established by a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time off in lieu&lt;/strong&gt; - In the US, this is only for the public sector, but many workers agree to take the time and half off, instead of the time and a half pay - in exchange for overtime work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compressed workshifts&lt;/strong&gt; - Allows employees to work the same number of hours, but usually in fewer days, for example, in four ten hour shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy time-off&lt;/strong&gt; - Easily accommodates casual or as-needed employees while keeping them on a formal payroll.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of the above can work to keep older employees happy and productive.&lt;/strong&gt; In fact, in many cases, they’ll seriously increase productivity. Though these kinds of scheduling changes may come as quite a surprise, implementing them can be managed effectively and efficiently with no disruption in workplace performance. Here’s what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-all-operations-requirements&quot;&gt;1. Review all operations requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establish requirements for all on-site cover during all possible shifts, and review with all relevant managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-your-tech-set-up&quot;&gt;2. Review your tech set up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeworkers can present a number of networking, security and related technical challenges. So this one can present a bigger task than it might first seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitoring&quot;&gt; 3. Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave this till last! Review early on how you are going to evaluate the effectiveness and productivity of employee’s new hours and shifts. You’ll want to be watching not only bottom line numbers, but also morale and absenteeism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-your-goals&quot;&gt;4. Manage your goals!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All shift managers should be fully informed of the “what, how and why” of all the changes you’re making, especially if they’ve been at it a while. Any manager knows the culture of the workplace well, and often times, they know it better than their superiors. Work closely with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-expectations&quot;&gt;5. Manage expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good employees understand the bottom line. Even when they’re jumping at the chance for more flexible scheduling, they should also be made aware of production schedules, seasonal requirements or changes and as much as will allow them to remain a part of a vital and productive workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tracking Productivity Doesn't Mean Cutting Your Best Resource</title>
   <link href="/blog/tracking-productivity/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-18T00:24:43-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/tracking-productivity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking-productivityhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201302tracking-productivityjpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201302tracking-productivityjpgtracking-productivity-is-not-always-as-an-apples-to-apples-comparison---but-its-worth-it-to-figure-out-the-fruit-youre-looking-at&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tracking-productivity.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tracking-productivity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tracking Productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tracking Productivity is not always as an apples to apples comparison - but it’s worth it to figure out the fruit you’re looking at!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking productivity can take all kinds of forms, figures and spreadsheets. It doesn’t always give you the perfect picture, but no matter what your looking at, checking out the way your people are coming together and what they’re contributing has gotten easier and more worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you should jump to easy conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of your people is probably a number you can easily name. What was last month’s total payroll, after all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a similar number cannot be named when it comes to evaluating the hours your company just received. We can call that number “productivity” and tracking productivity should not come at the cost of cutting your best players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking-productivity-across-teams-shifts-and-departments&quot;&gt;Tracking Productivity Across Teams, Shifts and Departments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculating and recording labor costs for every team on every project is a must. Lots of software developers and marketers will try to convince you - and they’re not wrong. Without clearly understanding the resources you’re deploying you will simply not get a clear picture of  the most cost-effective and efficient team that you can put toward any business goal. That’s true in software development as it’s true in running a retail operation or any small or mid-sized business. The fact is, every larger business is probably way ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can still compete - and even beat them at their own game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most managers will tell you to start with payroll, but the place to start is with your chief revenue generating activities. The goal is ultimately to develop a greater insight into your employees’ behavior and output so that you can make better decisions about managing and directing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Jump to Short-Term Savings Based on Staffing Cuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least not without carefully considering the costs. They may be a lot higher than you bargain for, and even with relatively low-skilled employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing growth and performance is not always a matter of cutting costs particularly when you have experienced staff who’ve been with you for any length of time. Lower staff morale, job-insecurity and short-term blows to esteem can show up quickly in flagging numbers all across your spreadsheets. Rather, when tracking productivity, you need to carefully consider the morale, attitude, and disposition of every team member, or perhaps leader, and figure that into your caluculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no known &lt;strong&gt;Project and Portfolio Management tool&lt;/strong&gt; that will accurately measure or reflect the human value you get from good team leaders. They do a job, and they keep everyone else excited about it too. That’s really the art of management, and no science will make up for that kind of value. Optimizing and managing a diverse and multi-skilled group of teams still requires a human touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding duplication and overlap of skills and capabilities takes insight into your market and your workflow processes. All of them. And all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, understanding employee attributes and costs distributions are not something you learn in an MBA program or that come hard-coded into your PPM. Tracking productivity across all of your teams and projects is something that’s worth doing for the next project, or for the end of this one. We’ll continue in the next post with more on how you can do it, better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Increase Productivity without Automating Everything!</title>
   <link href="/blog/increase-productivity/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-11T00:18:40-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/increase-productivity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;increase-productivityhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201302productivityjpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/productivity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;increase productivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-way-to-increase-productivity-is-long-and-engaging&quot;&gt;The Way to Increase Productivity is Long and Engaging…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-it-shouldnt-lead-to-employee-insecurity-doubt-and-increased-costs&quot;&gt;But it shouldn’t lead to employee insecurity, doubt and increased costs.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday someone will do a good workplace study about how much productivity is lost in the never-ending process of automating every single process that you can. Management processes can not ALL be automated, and the cost of automating even one of them can often be incalculably expensive in terms of down-time, roll-out and implementation costs and de-bugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, every industry, business model and field of commerce has an interest in increasing productivity. The shame is that this fact often gets interpreted to simply mean “more automation.” &lt;strong&gt;Often enough, the idea gets laid aside when the budget for automating comes to light - if it comes to light. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more open management - workforce communications process&lt;/strong&gt; is actually your best method to increase productivity. But before we get to actually increase productivity in your work force though, let’s look at what your workforce wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More flexible working hours or conditions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More understanding&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More opportunities for advancement&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More autonomy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s to name just a few things. We’re going to show you that providing more of any one of them - through more communications - will result in better satisfied, happier, more engaged and better focused employees. Ultimately - it will result in higher productivity, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need, as an employer or manager, probably looks more like this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specific skills and certifications&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance with whatever regulatory framework you’re working under&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A workforce that isn’t so old as to be obsolete&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enthusiastic attendance and not too many personal issues, illnesses or other expenses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other condition for business success can probably be met if your workforce is willing to work with it, and with you, and with your - and their -  environment.  Shortages of skills drive up costs and older workers may not be will to adjust or re-train. Insecurities and over-work lead to unmotivated and demoralized workforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**They’re simply not going to be productive enough. **Our number piece of advice then, is this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understand-workforce-worries-about-automation&quot;&gt;Understand Workforce Worries about Automation.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, consider the average employee’s concerns with regard to the list above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fact that many workers will tell you not to change anything evaporates in light of your being able to demonstrate specific benefits&lt;/strong&gt; that every employee receives - almost at no cost to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More flexible working hours or conditions?&lt;/strong&gt; This one is a no-brainer. Give your employees more say in when and how they work and they’ll work that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More understanding?&lt;/strong&gt; This one comes about when you free up employees to give feedback on all the processes and procedures they’re involved with. Some workplaces will even let it go on anonymously so that every employee is free to give feedback with no fear of management retribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More opportunities for advancement?&lt;/strong&gt; Suddenly, you should be able to quickly judge who are the more management-minded performers. It’s one more criteria, and one that you can make pay off for your employees (bonuses? promotions? recognition?) and for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More security?&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to above. When your business is in the black, it’s because you’ve got employees who are confident they’re doing they’re best and they’re being rewarded - or at least recognized - for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More satisfaction?&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond just recognition, management is able to quickly determine, based on feedback, what’s working and who’s satisfied and who’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**More autonomy? **All of the things above can be achieved by allowing - and automating - a more open communications process. It doesn’t ever happen overnight. Often it will come at the expense of some good managers who will balk at the very idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll return in another article to how the idea works for other business, how you can implement it, and how you can increase productivity without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vacation time for employees: 5 ways to make it work.</title>
   <link href="/blog/vacation-time-for-employees-how-can-you-make-it-work/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-04T00:33:35-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/vacation-time-for-employees-how-can-you-make-it-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;vacation-time-for-employeeshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201302vacation-time-for-employeesjpgvacation-time-for-employees-improves-productivity-attendance-rates-and-worker-satisfaction&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/vacation-time-for-employees.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;vacation time for employees&quot; /&gt;Vacation Time for Employees improves productivity, attendance rates and worker satisfaction.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is - only employers seem to know it, and most of them don’t make the most of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your workforce is something you value - but turnover is higher than you’d like and a few star performers really keep your ship afloat then read carefully and take the appropriate steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best performers may very well be juggling a continual dilemma in their minds. You pay them well, but they always doubt that it’s enough. You’re probably not totally comfortable with the rest of the portfolio of benefits you offer, either. Some of them - health insurance for example - are probably exceedingly expensive. There’s a not a lot of room for improvement there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, you’ve probably even tweaked policies to try to get the most out of most of your benefits pacakge, to make employees happy and maybe you’ve even bent policy rules for some employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But vacation time for employees is one of the most neglected and “under-tweaked” of benefits that are typically offered by mid-sized and larger businesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These five tips for optimizing vacation time for employees are designed not only to get your employees to take their vacation days, but to improve employee morale, and to better retain the employees most important to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remind-all-employees-of-the-policy-on-vacation-time-for-employees-at-least-once-every-year&quot;&gt;1) Remind All Employees of the Policy on Vacation Time for Employees at least once every year.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a relatively formal email that spells out the way the policy is enforced and what’s the required notification time and all of the details. Even this formal message can have a profound effect on the thinking and reception of all of your labor force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;management-and-key-employees-need-to-know-that-you-understand-the-benefits-of-actually-taking-vacation-time&quot;&gt;2) Management and Key Employees need to Know that you understand the benefits of actually taking vacation time.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often enough, they really don’t know. Especially star performers are pushing themselves. Sometimes too hard. But more important, if they’re pushing themselves at all, they really will be better performers with a few, regularly scheduled, paid days of rest. Just like you may have your doubts, they have even more doubts. &lt;strong&gt;That’s what makes them star performers!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell them. Reassuring key employees and star players that their time off is theirs and they are encouraged to take it just makes sense. You may send an email to the lot of them explaining exactly what management thinks, why management thinks so and what they can do to schedule a day off. It works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-vacation-time-for-employees-easy-to-schedule&quot;&gt;3) Make vacation time for employees easy to schedule.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s one or two days or a full week off, employees don’t want to go to speak with a distant HR person. They have their own reservations and concerns. Employees should be able to get approval from an immediate supervisor with whom they’re comfortable and be able to schedule the actual time-off by email or your online scheduling software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-it-private&quot;&gt;4) Keep it private!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one is important for really good employees, and it often gets overlooked.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not a solid gold rule, but some key players still feel a sense of shame that they’re taking time off because their work ethic is simply important to them. It doesn’t need to be ridiculed even if it is contrary to the official disposition we’re spelling out here. Even while you are publicly encouraging vacation time - you can still respect when employees don’t necessarily want to announce that they’ll be taking time off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;celebrate-selectively&quot;&gt;5) Celebrate selectively&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With respect to that same privacy, it is always a good idea to welcome your employees back!&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly if you know their vacation was for a special occasion, a wedding or anniversary trip, or maybe it was just for something extra special - a solid acknowledgement after the fact is also important. Vacations can be highlights to professional lives as well as to personal lives, and there’s no reason why employees won’t appreciate that much more knowing that you are glad they’re back. This can also be an important directive for their more immediate supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vacation time for employees is not just an expensive downtime. It’s a key part of employee retention, and one that will work. You’ll see employees turning down offers for more money just because they know that you are willing to manage employee stress and job-site policy with them in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Workforce Management Optimization for the New Year</title>
   <link href="/blog/workforce-management-optimization/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-20T23:39:24-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/workforce-management-optimization</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/workforce-management.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;workforce management optimization&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;workforce-management-optimization&quot;&gt;Workforce Management Optimization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-than-another-white-wash&quot;&gt;Better than another White-Wash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand you’re always dressing up your organization, putting a smiley face on the daily grind. Most likely you’re also tweaking efficiency to get more for less with the same resources - and doing so in an environment where your competitors always have more more more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More resources, more at their disposal and more to lose - and without any suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smaller and mid-sized companies are always trying to get more, too.&lt;/strong&gt; More to sell, more to brag about or more to turn to gold. It’s funny then that the team you’ve assembled is often the last thing you think of when it comes to optimizing your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, your workforce may be one of the most valuable assets your company possesses. And optimizing them is one of the last things managers think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the clients we talk to have optimized their payroll. They work with an efficient outside payroll accounting agency. Many of them have the same company doing all of their books. All - or nearly all - of their overhead is managed by a similar firm, and often one team member is devoted just to keeping an eye on all of these outside partners. Reducing costs is the overall aim, but you’ve got that nagging feeling that you’re forgetting something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why is your workforce off the hook.&lt;/strong&gt; They’re not just going to stand around while everything in your workplace is optimized and tweaked and tuned to optimal operating efficiency. Automating manual processes for tracking employee time and workday attendance cuts way down on all of the time, hassle and expense associated with punchcard time-clocks. (You’d be surprised how many of them we still see.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s suggest that giving your work teams or staff a bit more control over their work schedules - and ultimately over their lives - is something that would give you more control over your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Optimizing people actually means treating them more like, well, people! **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose your most productive employees were rewarded by giving them the chance to only show up for their most productive hours. And that doing this actually gave you everything you had before, but &lt;strong&gt;now with a more productive - and more devoted employee.&lt;/strong&gt; Wow. The rules are yours to establish, and the benefits can be tweaked, upgraded and scaled to your business - almost without end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workforce-management-optimization---the-easy-way&quot;&gt;Workforce Management Optimization - The Easy Way!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule is one of the easiest workforce management systems to roll out&lt;/strong&gt; - it’s all cloud based, fast and accessible from anywhere. Remember - any manual process that you can automate and make simpler should reduce costs - in theory. There are usually expensive roll out processes, prone to errors and crashes - and there’s a learning curve during which you can be losing all kinds of money, or business or opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule is designed to roll-out instantly and provide big benefits with a very, very short learning curve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits to your workforce are instant - and they’ll know it from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule allows you to instantly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimize work schedules&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward star performers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introduce flex-time or just slightly more flexible scheduling&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automate complex and confusing schedules&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regulate hours worked&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish and enforce rules&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verify attendance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyze performance based on your own indicators&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing your workforce just may turn out to be one of the easiest things you do this year. But the increases in performance and productivity can be outstanding. The benefits you reap can be measured in loyalty, output, and increased attention to the jobs their doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might even be surprised how many really good employees you can hold onto just by offering them more control over their working hours and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s no way we can white wash that!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Summary of ObamaCare for Your Small Business</title>
   <link href="/blog/summary-of-obamacare/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-14T00:32:20-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/summary-of-obamacare</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Doctor-w-medical-records-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Summary of ObamaCare Implications for Business&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-of-obamacare&quot;&gt;Summary of ObamaCare&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; works with so many small and medium sized business, it’s in our own interest to always stay current with the trends and policy changes that affect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cost of health care everyone in the U.S. has continued to skyrocket, the number of smaller and mid-sized businesses able to offer any health insurance has basically cratered. ObamaCare, “The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” will reduce many of the premiums for individuals and for businesses. The aim is to achieve is basically by increasing the number of healthy people paying into the larger insurance pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses with fewer than 25 full-time employees will be able to insure those employees, through tax credits, and employers with more than 50 full-time employees are mandated to pay a percentage of their employees’ coverage. Most studies have shown that ObamaCare should help to generate literally millions of new private and public sector jobs. Nearly of half of those presently uninsured work for small businesses or are dependent on someone who does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;help-for-small-businesses&quot;&gt;Help for Small Businesses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of far more affordable insurance options increases under the new plan, most small businesses will seriously benefit from ObamaCare, but will in fact benefit. Mid-sized businesses will, however feel the impact of new taxes and the insurance mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it isn’t necessary to immediately slash the working hours of your entire staff, that has been the initial alarm sounded by some very high income “small businesses” who’ve been able to qualify as small businesses in the past, in part to avoid similar regulations. Fines ranging from $2,000 to $3,000 per employee per year are possible, in part, in order to cover the healthcare costs of those uncovered employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business owners are currently limiting their own budgeting and planning due to uncertainty and while the insurance exchanges and other options are made clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-more-part-time-employees-the-answer&quot;&gt;Are More Part-Time Employees the Answer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many businesses are considering limitations on the weekly hours that employees can work. At least until the options are clear, this may be a short term or interim solution. Preparing for change and better management during the transition is in every manager’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guess what though?  Now you’ve got a scheduling nightmare&lt;/strong&gt; that can be expensive, complicated and very difficult to track. Time tracking, schedules, payroll and benefits administration, all need closely-kept records. NimbleShedule provides a cloud-based system not only for time-tracking, clocking and scheduling, but for keeping real-time records and an auditable trail. We regularly save mid-sized businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars in the costs of compliance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-engagement/&quot;&gt;We’ve detailed in other articles what we can do for your productivity&lt;/a&gt;! But don’t forget &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; also provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlimited Schedules for unlimited departments, titles or teams&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple intuitive cloud-based interface for whomever needs it&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even complex schedules are set - and changed - and on the fly&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full automation for easy roll out, no matter how advanced your own current systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schedule changes and clocking in by email, smartphone or internet&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full synching with Google Calendar, iCal and Facebook Calendar&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real-time schedules are synched and ready to go as fast as you are&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And multiple, overlapping full and part-time schedules can be handled as easily as checking your Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter you strategy for adapting to the new ObamaCare regulations and environment, we’ll be happy to put &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt;’s powerful, automated software to work for your business. The benefits are affordable and will quickly get you through to the next phase of ObamaCare.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Engagement: This Year's Hottest Tip!</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-engagement/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-06T23:06:08-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-engagement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/employee-engagement.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee engagement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;employee-engagement-is-more-than-a-buzzword-from-the-hr-industry&quot;&gt;Employee engagement is more than a buzzword from the HR industry.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employee engagement is real, matters big time, and it something that managers can start working on now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance may be everything. But employees aren’t machines,&lt;/strong&gt; and they won’t ever be, and those who continue to ignore the basic tenets of employee engagement will always be losing out to the firms who take them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When employees are given the opportunity to reach their own highest potentials, any organization connected with those employees is guaranteed to benefit. Customers get better service, much higher efficiency rates are achieved and overall waste is reduced, or even eliminated. Striving for peak performance means enhancing every aspect of employee engagement and continually monitoring for way to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low employee engagement costs and costs real money, in terms of poor performance, disinterested sales or other performance numbers and wasted time, energy and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-absence-and-lateness-issues&quot;&gt;Employee Absence and Lateness Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine telling your late employees that it’s all fine. Want to miss a day? Just let us know. Want to work double shifts? No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateness and missed shifts are one big indicator that your employees are not engaged and they’ve got other priorities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem counter-intuitive but giving them what they want may also be exactly the solution you need. Imagine getting better engagement while seemingly rewarding exactly the behavior you’d been planning to stamp out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look at it this way; respecting their priorities is a huge step toward getting them to respect yours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matching-priorities-is-the-first-step-to-better-employee-engagement&quot;&gt;Matching Priorities is the First Step to Better Employee Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule is designed to allow any organization to measure and quantify absence levels&lt;/strong&gt; and lateness and to analyze those numbers. While giving your employees more freedom to come and go as they please, you’re also getting far better data on who is really performing. Even if they’re doing it in less time, or more at their own pace, you get a much better picture, no matter the skill level or job level or title. Matching time worked with job performance indicators could not be easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting a fuller, bigger, brighter picture of who is engaged is easier too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That lack of employee engagement has a way of contaminating anyone and everyone around the disengaged employee. Resentments over additional pressures and increased workloads make all kinds of people unhappy. Next thing you know, even diligent workers are disengaging. With NimbleSchedule, managers are able to quickly see who is working when, who is clocking-in or clocking-off when, and they can reward the diligent and better control those whose other performance numbers don’t meet the standards set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by knowing the scale of any unscheduled absence issue managers are better able to address it and get adequate solutions in place for the workers who deserve them. It’s something you simply cannot do with paper records and called-in lateness excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule is an automated real time management solution&lt;/strong&gt; designed to give even very large organizations clearer processes and better control. That’s at the same time that it’s increasing employee engagement and improving performance numbers across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with performance teams in every industry to show you how you can better provide flexibility and scheduling ease so that managers can better monitor engagement. Instead of working and re-working complicated shift-schedules, they let their teams do that on their own, and concentrate on keeping employees engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; then puts the reports and the custom numbers in place so you get a first hand real time view of what just happened. With your teams’ performance, or with multiple teams competing, it’s easy to see who’s on top and where the adjustments need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With improved employee engagement at the top of your priorities, you may just wonder how you focused on the minor details for as long as you did.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More Flexible Time Clocking from NimbleSchedule</title>
   <link href="/blog/flexible-time-clocking/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-01T10:42:33-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flexible-time-clocking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;nimbleschedule-adds-spri-mobile-time-clocking-to-help-businessesspend-more-time-watching-the-bottom-line&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule adds SPRI Mobile Time Clocking to Help Businesses Spend More Time Watching The Bottom Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**NimbleSchedule adds a new function to its time and attendance software that allows text and phone clock-in capabilities.**&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlsbad, CA based NimbleSchedule announced the launch of SPRI (SMS and Phone Registry Integration) as an added feature to its online time and attendance software platform NimbleSchedule.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new function allows NimbleSchedule.com users to clock-in to their assigned work schedules from field locations via text, or calling in from their cell phone. SPRI is offered as a compliment to NimbleSchedule.com’s online time clock utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Many of our customers have employees that spend the majority of their time at work sites away from their corporate office,&quot; said the company founder and CEO Peter Swaniker. With SPRI those employees can simply send a text message or call to clock-in for their shift.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPRI uses customer specific security protocols to verify that the employee is clocking-in from their phone or mobile device. Employees that use the system are automatically checked-in to NimbleSchedule.com’s, cloud-based time and attendance software. The online time clock utility then matches the employee’s information with their assigned work schedule. This gives employees the ability to easily stay connected, and managers the ability to monitor employee activity from any web-enabled device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;With SPRI added to our increasing list of tools, like our Facebook integration and our proprietary shift management utility, we are developing NimbleSchedule to be the only choice for online time and attendance management,&quot; said Swaniker. SPRI can be added to any NimbleSchedule.com plan package and can be integrated quickly. Plan packages can be customized to match the complexity and budget needs nearly any size enterprise.

   <title>Flexible Work Schedules</title>
   <link href="/blog/flexible-work-schedules/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-25T23:39:55-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flexible-work-schedules</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-work-schedules-and-the-greatest-employment-advantage-in-the-world&quot;&gt;Flexible Work Schedules and the Greatest Employment Advantage in the World.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a lot of talk in the air about improving the engagement, attentiveness and level of professionalism among employees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no question that employee  productivity is directly linked to employee engagement.&lt;/strong&gt; Employees who are worrying about their lives off the job - meeting other scheduling demands, family necessities and doctor appointments, picking up the kids from school - are guaranteed to be less productive players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_257” align=”alignright” width=”289”]&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/workplace-flexibility-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flexible Work Schedules&quot; /&gt; You can do it ![/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know as well as we do - good employees are in demand. In your place of business, at home and probably in their communities too, good employees are like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studies indicate that good, engaged and happy employees are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Willing to stay five times longer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working at twice the productive capacity of their unhappy peers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;90% less likely to call in sick&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any organization struggling to keep employees - and to keep them happy - should think long and hard about instituting a quick, easy and self-maintaining scheduling system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-scheduling-and-employee-engagement&quot;&gt;Flexible scheduling and employee engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering employees the ability to seriously maintain work-life balance while actually boosting productivity might sound like a fantasy from some other world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fact is, NimbleSchedule does it now,&lt;/strong&gt; with an easy roll-out that replaces all of your paper and excel-sheet scheduling. There’s nothing to post on the wall, and every employee gets a welcome email, with instructions to keep going, right from the first day its implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every manager and scheduling department employee can customize to their heart’s content, so that rules are rules and they’re perfect for each individual department, team or shift. However you’re already breaking things down, we can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, now individual team members can, where you permit them, opt on or off of shifts. They can tell you they’ll be late, and someone else can fill in the gaps. All of this can be done by email, text or internet - from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of your staffing is better aligned with your business demands, and shift-swapping, flexible working, and annualized hours can better be implemented. The advantages you get from clearly demonstrating to staff that the organization takes them seriously really can’t be over-emphasized. Here’s what else you’ll do…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improve-productivity&quot;&gt;Improve Productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even complex work schedules get done in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;control-payroll-costs&quot;&gt;Control Payroll Costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you set the rules, you’re better able to control over-time while still managing dozens or even hundreds of employees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minimize-errors&quot;&gt;Minimize Errors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts are foreseeable, easy to control, and everyone concerned gets an email. No shift goes un-staffed, or understaffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seriously-improve-morale&quot;&gt;Seriously Improve Morale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happier, more involved and better managed employees are what it’s all about! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them can feel like they’re being given more control, and they’re then able to better focus on their jobs, better enjoy them and still have productive, outstanding lives off the job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees are managing themselves, and their schedules, to a far greater degree than ever  before, and your business is reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re considering putting some real star employees on fully flex-time schedules, or your needs are simpler, with NimbleSchedule in place, you’re also positioned to grow. Fully scalable, we’ve test run NimbleSchedule on just a few departments, and later rolled it out for an entire organization - in this case, a large hospital. Everyone from surgeons to groundskeepers could check their schedules, clock in or out and schedule a vacation from the same interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule is ready to make the leap. Are you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>End employ absenteeism - in this lifetime.</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-absenteeis/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-09T23:26:25-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-absenteeis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/employee-absenteeism-001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/employee-absenteeism-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-absenteeism-costs-us-businesses-billions&quot;&gt;Employee Absenteeism costs U.S. Businesses Billions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-it-costing-yours&quot;&gt;Is it costing yours?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year employee absenteeism costs American businesses - literally - billions of dollars. Those costs are not just for lost productivity. Even the cost of keeping track of when employees are showing up - and when they’re not  - adds up to a tremendous amount of money - and that’s year upon year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In larger organizations, every single manager accountable for the schedules of more than 1 employee is losing somewhere between one and two hours every week - just on scheduling and making up for absences, dropped shifts, missed shifts and sick-days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In larger industries, one business alone can easily be losing over ten million dollars annually because they’re scheduling is not flexible and not easy enough to use - by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-flexible-does-flexible-scheduling-have-to-be&quot;&gt;How flexible does Flexible Scheduling have to be?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top reasons that employees call in sick when they aren’t actually sick are stress and a sense of being overworked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yet most managers still feel - and perhaps rightly - that they simply cannot give every employee the flexibility to simply show up when they feel like it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible scheduling - while it will dramatically improve employee absenteeism - does not necessarily mean flex-time for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving engagement and productivity, including that of scheduling managers is the name of the game. But “show up when you feel like it” is not what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; users have set custom rules that allow increasing levels of flexibility based on job title, skills, seniority and other factors. Lower-level employees still enjoy the ability to add or drop shifts via email, internet or even text message. That ability alone saves every business we work with the time it would take to reconfigure a schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clocking in by cell phone, internet or tablet also gives a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Scheduling managers can work with a clear and accurate picture, and still allow greater freedom to every level of employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt;’s reporting features allow you to instantly analyze trends or absenteeism rates so that you know the difference between a real problem, and someone who just needs a bit more freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those much more self-scheduled employees now enjoy a far greater sense of control over their work lives. Because you set the rules, employees will much more willingly adjust to the rules with their own schedules, which are suddenly much more accommodating. Just knowing that you can easily have four hours for your own professional appointments during a regular work week makes life a lot easier. It also makes employees see that they’ve got a responsive, understanding manager looking after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managers are spending more time on creating and encouraging engagement rather than on administering time schedules, and employees are enjoying a far greater sense of freedom and control over their work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Improve employee retention with better work schedules</title>
   <link href="/blog/improve-employee-retention/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-02T23:30:05-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/improve-employee-retention</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;improve-employee-retentionhttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201211employee-retention-001pngis-your-most-important-resource-walking-out-the-door&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/employee-retention-001.png&quot; alt=&quot;improve employee retention&quot; /&gt;Is your most important resource walking out the door?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right when you need them most - your most experienced, most professional or simply your most valuable employee is going to up and quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not pretty - and thank goodness, it doesn’t happen every week - but it does happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be at the beginning of your busiest season. Or it could be two weeks before the most important event in the company’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most valuable employees have a a way of  doing that. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, because guess what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more valuable your employee the more likely that they are in demand - elsewhere!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving employee retention is one of the great goals of any hiring manager, supervisor or HR professional. Once one good employee walks, it’s just possible that others are going to up and walk out too. Then you’re really in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We even have a client in Human Resource who found herself doing overtime in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;news-flash-good-employees-have-lives&quot;&gt;News Flash: Good Employees Have Lives!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respecting their lives - and finding out about them - is a really good way to keep the best performers happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An engineering firm we worked with in the last year told us that - much to their surprise - they didn’t know that one of their top performing team leaders was moonlighting as a concert pianist.&lt;/strong&gt; He’d been using vacation and sick days to pursue what he liked better, and he was this close to walking when they contacted &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firm knew this particular engineer wasn’t performing nine to five, Monday through Friday anyway.  He was already working strange hours and making up shifts - and generally creating havoc for the shift schedulers. And the dispatchers, and the people on his team. &lt;strong&gt;But he was that valuable, and losing him would have meant months searching for a replacement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer was a smart scheduling solution that the team-lead can check when he wants to. He can schedule time on and off the clock the way he wants, and pursue a music career at the same time. The company is doing better than ever and they saved a fortune in recruiting and down-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; lets the entire team check in via remote, schedule days off by email and work much more agreeable, pleasant and life-friendly schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Advantages for Employees are these:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better time management&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better control over their own work and life schedules&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More job satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More time to enjoy all the other things that employees enjoy, family, friends, hobbies and free time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the Advantages for Employers using NimbleSchedule are even more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employee Retention is seriously improved for much happier employees&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complex or simple flex-time is handled easily&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shifts can be scheduled in advance, or even at the last minute, with far fewer absences, cancellations or dropped shifts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire work scheduling package integrates easily with existing systems, and it’s internet based and accessible to who ever needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone gets updated as often as they need to by text, email or internet&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reporting and data analysis mean that you can continually monitor the vastly improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not everyone needs to let all their employees show up on a foot-loose flex-time plan,&lt;/strong&gt; but enhanced internet-based scheduling makes a big difference. Employees know that you respect their personal lives, and all the obligations and constraints they’re also facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason alone, &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/strong&gt; will make a big difference in your employee retention efforts. And with everything else, you’ll wonder how you lived without it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Workforce Management</title>
   <link href="/blog/workforce-management/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-09T09:23:02-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/workforce-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Ten Workforce Management Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s work environment it is more important than ever to have multiple techniques when it comes to managing your workforce. The economy has created a more competitive environment when it comes to fighting for your market share. With this competition comes a need to proactively manage your workforce in a way which keeps them motivated and performing at a high level. There are many things to take into account with your associate base, and we will list the top ten workforce management tools here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Recruitment Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solid recruitment strategy is key to any business. Without a recruitment strategy, many hiring managers will waste time and energy focusing on the wrong things and chasing down leads that are unqualified. It is imperative to determine the profile of the employee that your business is looking for, and then determine what avenues you can reach prospective employees for your business. A comprehensive, step-by-step strategy needs to be developed to attract the type of qualified candidates you are looking for. A budged amount for recruitment, where and how to look, who should do the recruiting along with recruiting success metrics are key features of a good strategy. Focused advertising, employee referral programs, and recruitment firms are all keys to a successful strategy development. In 2012, Southwest Airlines utilized its focused recruitment strategy to attract 50,000 applicants for 500 job openings. This allows them to hire the best of the best - so should you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Have Involved Ownership/Management In the Hiring Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a manager or business owner you want to create a great company culture, a large piece of this is involvement from ownership and management right from the beginning. Research has shown one of the worst moves a business can make is having ownership or management disengage in the hiring process. This is such a critical piece of the business, as these are the people who will or will not drive your success. It is imperative to have ownership in a small business involved in the hiring decisions, and in a larger environment, it is important to have key leadership roles involved in hiring decisions, not just the hiring manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Utilize Emotional Intelligence Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to assess both potential and current employees’ levels of emotional intelligence. This can lead to better hiring decisions, as well as better growth opportunities for those in the company already. Research has shown that testing emotional intelligence is a greater predictor of job success or failure as it assesses the level of cognitive and social abilities. An emotional intelligence test can help formulate how well a candidate will fit into the organization, as well as how a current employee may fit into a new role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Remote Workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there is an increasing need for remote workers due to economic decisions as well as lifestyle decisions. With the technology available today, many businesses can handle a remote workplace a few days a week for their employees. This can help retain employees who have child care issues, and help drive down costs for commuting. Nearly 10% of today’s workforce works remotely from home, and this will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Create A Great Company Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of your employees, it is important to create a great company culture. This is one that celebrates success, and has transparent leadership. If employees can have fun at the workplace, and know exactly what their leadership is looking for, they will succeed. Research has shown that employees working for companies with an engaged culture are more productive on a daily basis and willing to take risks to benefit the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Take Care of Your Top Talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies fail to take the best care of their top talent and instead often focus on the bottom 10% of their workforce. Instead of trying to fix the problematic employee, let them go. That time and energy should be expended with your top 10% of the workforce, encouraging them, spending time with them, and helping them grow. These are the people who will make your company great if you treat them well. Research has shown that top producers don’t leave because they aren’t paid well, but because their efforts often go unrewarded in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Offer Unique Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be able to recruit and hold the best employees, it is important to offer great workplace benefits. These need not just be health insurance, 401K, and vacation time. Some of the companies with the best retention are offering unique benefits. Timberland offers a $3,000 bonus for employees to buy a hybrid car. Eli Lilly allows one month paid leave before having a baby. Worthington Industries offers onsite haircuts to employees for $4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Offer Onsite Child Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many families now having two working parents, childcare can be not only expensive, but a travel difficulty for working moms and dads. Companies now offer childcare onsite to help open up the labor force, and keep the business open for the hours they need their employees to be productive. Many companies can subsidize a portion of the childcare, making it more convenient and less expensive for their employees. In a recent survey it was found that SAS Institute, Aflac, Bright Horizons all offered the least expensive monthly options for childcare to their employees onsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Employee Review Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that a company have a consistent method of evaluating employees on a regular basis. People want to know where they stand and how to improve to get to the next level. This conversation should happen more often than once a year. There are HRIS systems that can be adopted to make this seamless across the company. Benchmark Assisted Living has adopted this as a best practice and seen their employee retention increase 25% year over year for the past two years. They have also seen a 50% increase of promotion from within during that time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Offer Performance Bonuses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To best maximize production from your employees, offer performance bonuses based upon their individual performance as well as that of the entire office. Make these clear and known to everyone. Research shows that utilizing a performance bonus tied to the individual and the office goals is much more effective at motivating and retaining the workforce than utilizing a yearly bonus or a holiday bonus that all share an equal piece of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;staff-scheduling-software-that-gives-back&quot;&gt;Staff Scheduling Software That Gives Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already know that online employee scheduling and notification is the way to go. &lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule lets you email everyone at once, and send text messages to those far flung employees who read everything off of their cell phone or tablet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule manages employee schedules - weekly and monthly and rotating shifts - for doctors and hotel workers and restaurants. Staff scheduling managers breathe a lot easier and nobody misses work cause they didn’t know about a shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;referral-rewards-that-keep-your-business-flush&quot;&gt;Referral Rewards that keep your Business Flush!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, signing up your neighbor’s business or one of your suppliers has gotten that much more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say one of your suppliers keeps missing a delivery. Maybe the driver didn’t know he had to show up that day. The driver’s company is probably suffering through the same complicated scheduling and staff notification problems that you used to go through. And let’s face it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody knows remote workers and delivery drivers better than the customers on the receiving end! **(and that means YOU!)&lt;/strong&gt;
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule will pay all of our active customers back for business referrals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.nimbleschedule.com/authentication/signin?ReturnUrl=%2f&quot;&gt;Just check the log-on screen… here&lt;/a&gt; before you log on. Fill in your favorite referrals, or the company that you think needs a kick in the pants!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new customer for us means better delivery, better services and more helpful providers, no matter who you’re relying on. &lt;strong&gt;It can also mean valuable gifts that are our way of saying thank you. These can include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gift Certificates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donations to your favorite charity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or even future Credits toward your own NimbleSchedule subscription!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just submit your referral’s name, address and contact info from the NimbleSchedule log-on page. When your referral signs up for a paid subscription to NimbleSchedule, we’ll contact you. You can choose from any of the above gifts and rewards, and maybe most important, you’ll see better work and delivery performance from your referral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also enjoy seeing that the business and performance of your referral is steadily improving as workers and staff members show up on time, and the entire staff is happier with the work schedules that they’re better able to control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flextime-scheduling-that-makes-sense&quot;&gt;FlexTime Scheduling that Makes Sense!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of our best customers are relying on out-sourcers to put people to work under their own roofs. That means our customers’ own employees are getting to work on time, but they’re still witnessing employee scheduling performed the old-fashioned, grueling and inefficient way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your provider is sending you confused and bleary-eyed workers, let us know!&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll get them onto the right path with efficient, internet and remote staff scheduling software - &lt;strong&gt;and we’ll reward you for the tip.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Doctors Office Scheduling Software Made Easy</title>
   <link href="/blog/doctors-office-scheduling-software/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-17T00:31:20-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/doctors-office-scheduling-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/scheduling-software-medical-office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scheduling software medical office&quot; /&gt;Doctors Office scheduling software has become a vital part of just about any medical practice you can name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physicians’ practices have diversified and with them has come an array not only of different specialists, but of all of the support staff too. &lt;strong&gt;Even very small doctors’ offices with limited staff scheduling needs benefit from automating the process and keeping everyone in the loop via email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical offices, hospitals, home health services, and specialized facilities and personnel are all relying on software to get the right people notified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;doctors-office-scheduling-software-has-arrived-just-in-time&quot;&gt;Doctors Office Scheduling Software has arrived just in time!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time - and in the right place - has become increasingly complicated, even as it’s become increasingly important to the overll operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialized services mean increasingly specialized personnel on all levels. As support staff come with increasing skills, they also come with more complicated scheduling requirements - and lives that need tending to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing quite as frustrating as losing staff because you can’t be more flexible with their scheduling needs. We’ll tell you how to achieve total schedule mastery, while retaining the best talent on schedules that absolutely satisfy their needs, without any extra paperwork. In fact, Doctors’ offices are easily streamlining their entire scheduling department AND making employee’s happier. All of that’s happening with the Doctors Office Scheduling software solution that’s making life easier for staff schedulers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;staff-scheduling-with-total-organizational-control&quot;&gt;Staff Scheduling with Total Organizational Control&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re scheduling more than one physician, operating 24 hours a day and covering multiple locations, NimbleSchedule is the clear solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Separate schedules for doctors, nurses and as many departments as necessary.**
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Easily schedule rotating or fixed doctor&#39;s schedules.**
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Easy user management of every personalized schedule.**
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Manage schedule changes through a fully automated web and mobile interface.**
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Email or SMS notification system for everyone scheduled and for management.**
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Reach any doctor or staff member in moments, automatically.**
&amp;gt; 
	
&amp;gt;   * **Publish schedules to Facebook and Google Calendar.**
&amp;gt; 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even launch a full on flex-time schedule to reward your best employees, while managing more of them, and better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also get real time data on employee performance that let’s you see who is performing. Doctor or nurse availability and preferences are automated and instantly viewable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compressed-work-weeks-and-10-12-and-even-24-hour-fixed-or-rotating-shift-schedules-can-be-automated-and-put-into-effect-instantly&quot;&gt;Compressed work weeks and 10, 12, and even 24-hour fixed or rotating shift schedules can be automated and put into effect instantly.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part may be that you can easily manage far more staff - Doctors, Nurses and Technicians. You’ll be far more able to keep all of them happy too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who doesn’t prefer to easily fill in their own schedule and hours? Even when they’re based on the rules that you predetermine, hours and shifts can be better met for high demand times and everyone on your staff can better plan their work week - and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nimbleschedule-is-all-the-doctors-office-scheduling-software-you-need&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule is all the Doctors Office Scheduling Software you need.&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Veterinary Staff Scheduling</title>
   <link href="/blog/veterinary-staff-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-28T02:43:37-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/veterinary-staff-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-industry-scheduling-softwarehttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201208veterinary-clinic-scheculing-softwarejpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/veterinary-clinic-scheculing-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Service Industry scheduling software&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-employee-work-schedule-in-a-dog-eat-dog-world&quot;&gt;The Employee Work Schedule in a Dog Eat Dog World!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PetQuarter Inc is the largest veterinary clinic in Northern Virginia. At 18 employees and seven volunteers, it’s not enormous. An average weekend will see no less than 60 animals, - cats, dogs and a few others - hurried through. With the areas only 24-hour emergency service, two employees are on hand all day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also an agricultural and equine service that keeps two full-time veterinarians on the road, sometimes in partnership and sometimes on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The employee work schedule has been drawn up by office manager, Samantha Essex, since the company opened its doors 14 years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Samantha, “We used to be one doctor and two assistants who worked basically from 11 until 7 or 8 PM for five, and sometimes six days, every week. That was easy enough, but people like their vet and they like the way we handle the office and keep their pets calm and separate when they come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So pretty soon we’ve got people coming back and recommending us and what used to be five or six scheduled surgeries has turned into 20 - 25 scheduled treatments and five emergencies and a bunch of walk-ins for lesser issues or advice. We’ve got two people shampooing and cutting hair and three on Saturdays, plus a driver. And about half of our people are part time, and would like to work more but they’re not all on the same schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The employee work schedule got to be way more than could be posted on the wall every week.&lt;/strong&gt; It changed or people couldn’t make it and other people wanted to fill in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Samantha’s words, “Of course, I’m the office manager. I do everything in Excel! We did it that way for a long time. We printed out a sort of a calendar with everyone’s name and if people wanted to change it, I might eventually get mad, but it went pretty well. Really, that was before everyone had their smart phone. And before we started doing the farms and the horses. It made sense, and things weren’t as complicated and we weren’t as busy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-employee-work-schedule-that-works&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Employee Work Schedule that Works!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With everybody connected on their smart phones, we’ve got better people working. They use their iPhones to see if they need to come in here or make a house call. They can all work on weekends and better stagger their days off during the week when we’re a lot slower. The NimbleSchedule system lets them know when they got to be here and they can set up their own changes all they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The doctors are happy cause they can see the money is their and their schedules are the way they want them. If they need volunteers, we send a message out to a bunch of people who love to come and help out and the essential staff is there to support them too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samantha’s scheduling work comes down to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easier filling of every schedule through one internet based interface.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Auto-messaging by text an email to every employee who wants to know.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Auto confirmation and change requests, via smartphone or internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule makes it possible to schedule more people, easier, and to more flexibly schedule better people. It’s the employee work schedule solution for companies that want to grow and that grows right along with the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Flexible Student Shift Scheduling; Possible and Profitable</title>
   <link href="/blog/flexible-student-shift-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-14T00:56:36-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/flexible-student-shift-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;student-work-shift-scheduling-and-flex-time&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Work Shift Scheduling and Flex-Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible student shift scheduling has always been important, to the students who make up the workforce or the university staff, and to the full time shift schedulers or managers who need to get a job done. Few of us want a work schedule as complicated as an undergraduate class schedule. But today, it’s not only possible but even easy to maintain a staff of part-time student workers with a work schedule that’s just as complex as their class schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nimbleschedule-revolutionizes-flex-time&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule Revolutionizes Flex-Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flex-Time implies an advanced, demanding probably professional workforce, maybe with kids in daycare or at school and who just need a lot more time off. That used to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule is pleased to be present the software that makes Flex-Time&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;just as easy to manage&lt;/strong&gt; for student workers - with ultra complex scheduling needs - as it for shift managers. Whether you’re working in a university environment - or in the university itself - you’ll likely benefit from the many positive advances NimbleSchedule allows you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Secret is in always up-to-date availability and voluntary shift scheduling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truly flexible student shift scheduling demands a voluntary approach&lt;/strong&gt; that assures student workers really can work when they’re available, no matter how demanding the rest of their daytime (or night time) schedule might be. It also means you get happier workers, as many as you need, for the shifts that require them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flexible student shift scheduling plan allows your workers to establish and change their availability as often as you and they can agree. Some employers will allow updating preferences as often as every week, while others do it on a semester or seasonal basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-student-shift-scheduling-for-universitieshttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201208135jpghttpwwwnimbleschedulecomwp-contentuploads201208135jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/135.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/135.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flexible Student Shift Scheduling for Universities&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is check an employee’s preferences, as above, and either request them for a shift or allow them to fill in their own schedule as they wish. &lt;strong&gt;Notifications by SMS or email are as easy as making changes.&lt;/strong&gt; Both employee and manager can set their notification preferences individually, but the automation makes it easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flexible-student-shift-scheduling-is-as-easy-to-achieve-as-using-the-software&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Student Shift Scheduling is as easy to Achieve as Using the Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/133.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/133.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;University Flexible Student Shift Scheduling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Managers may either allow for pure voluntary shift scheduling, or check availability. Either way, shift workers are much happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficient employee scheduling software like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt; allows you to make the most of employee flexibility and electronic literacy. They can even coordinate their schedule with Facebook events or Google Calendar. You can easily manage as many part-time employees as you require and allow them to swap, add or drop shifts as often as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your entire staff can also continually check the schedule online, or from a smartphone or tablet. There’s no excuse for not being on the same page no matter how complex the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also establish as many rules and regulations regarding minimum or maximum hours, days or weekly standards as you or your business or university department require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As work schedules are finalized and approved, notifications can again be sent to everyone who needs to know, via SMS or email&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;e is a must-have staff scheduler&lt;/a&gt; that let’s you provide the flexible, balanced work environment your employees will absolutely love. And you’ll love the convenience and ease with which it rolls out and starts working, right from the beginning and week after flexible work week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-us-a-call-today-and-well-be-happy-to-show-you-how-you-can-make-your-university-work-environment-that-much-more-worker-friendly&quot;&gt;Give us a Call Today and We’ll be Happy to Show You How You Can Make Your University Work Environment that Much More Worker Friendly&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Multiple Time Zone Employee Shift Scheduling: Advantages and Necessities</title>
   <link href="/blog/multiple-time-zone-employee-shift-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-07T00:38:17-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/multiple-time-zone-employee-shift-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/time-zone-scheduler2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;employee scheduling multiple time zones&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling Employees across Multiple Time Zones is not only Necessary, it’s Easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple-time-zone-employee-shift-scheduling-technology-advances-make-it-easier-than-ever&quot;&gt;Multiple Time Zone Employee Shift Scheduling: Technology Advances Make it Easier than Ever.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple time zone employee shift scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; wasn’t always a necessity. A simple call center could get by with an old fashioned bulletin board. Even with multiple employee shifts, you post the shifts and hours and hope your people are good enough to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business success always depended on personalities and on personally choosing the employees right for the heavy shifts. The others can pull up loose ends on the late or early morning shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But as years goes by, perhaps your company has seen the advantages to opening a second or even a third call center&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe it’s a bigger one, in a far off location, with different overhead costs and wildly different scheduling needs. Letting a local manager juggle those hours and those personalities was good for a while. Maybe it even worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The true necessity of multiple time zone employee shift scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; comes when you realize you’ve got to take back some of that control. Most organizations, no matter how big, don’t maintain the same level of expertise at every center they’re working from. This holds true in healthcare, in technology and just about every field that needs to be working in multiple time-zones. Especially if it’s still managed from a central location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;The advantages to centralization**, no matter in what industry, are still simply too big to ignore. That’s true even when the advantages to having a local presence, local voices or a local call center are also too big to ignore. You simply don’t need an expert in every time zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;In the continually expanding call center industry, to name just one example, NimbleSchedule is allowing call center managers to maintain a center full of top notch experts. In the expensive Silicon Valley, calls only come through once they’ve been routed through 2 much less expensive call centers in Philippines and Florida. All three call centers depend on coordinated multiple time zone employee shift scheduling. An expert from every discipline is on call, for every shift, no matter where they are located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The savings to the company have been significant&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in terms of keeping the more than 60 Silicon Valley experts happy in their jobs. Each of them enjoys a far greater degree of autonomy in selecting and volunteering for shifts, while turn-over has dropped significantly at all three call centers. Employees are also better informed about their schedules through their own smart phones and tablets about when they can take vacation or sick days, and the entire process is managed from the parent company headquarters in Chicago. Integrated easily with Google Calendar and Facebook, everyone in the company knows who is working when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule has worked with similar companies in communications, retail, food service and hospitality - all of them spread out over multiple time zones, but none of them spread thin. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;Give us a call and let us know about your biggest scheduling problem and we’ll be happy to make your shift workers more nimble&lt;/a&gt;, and probably more happy too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your Staff Schedule on Facebook? Are You Crazy?</title>
   <link href="/blog/shift-scheduling-on-facebook/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-18T02:30:51-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/shift-scheduling-on-facebook</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/facebook-calendar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook Scheduling Integration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some companies just ban Facebook in the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smarter ones adapt to it and get the most out of their employees and the benefits that a thoughtful social media presence can have for almost any company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule has taken the whole thing a step further and now puts the most important part - for you anyway - right in the middle of the Facebook action.&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than banning Facebook to the old lunch room computer, face it, embrace it and use it to enhance the way your doing business and the way your company deals with employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employees are on Facebook now and they’re using it during work hours, during off hours and pretty much around the clock.&lt;/strong&gt; They access it on mobile devices on and off the corporate network and some of your best and brightest are probably using it to do their jobs, to find sales leads or opportunities, to research and to learn and yes, just to socialize. Some of them may even be networking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some industries and careers, it may be the best way yet to get the schedule in front of employees’ eyes. Imagine checking your next work shift like this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/18.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;calendar scheduling facebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already fully integrated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/shift-scheduling-google-calendar/&quot;&gt;with the more robust Google Calendar system&lt;/a&gt;, NimbleSchedule’s leap into the social sphere is another attempt to fully maximize &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/employee-retention-and-flexible-scheduling/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule’s already considerable employee retention capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_184” align=”alignright” width=”374”]&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MC-179295785-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scheduling Facebook &quot; /&gt; Just Look for the Facebook Calendar, now under your viewing options[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees can choose to view the schedule in either Google Calendar or Facebook along with a variety of other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with all of the automated notification settings that already make it the single best way to keep track of a wide and varied work force, we think it’s also a terrific way to introduce your company’s official Facebook and social media policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re not going to ban it outright, why not make Facebook the frontline of your public outreach.&lt;/strong&gt; Along with a more satisfied, flexibly scheduled and content workforce, you also get the added benefit of having more of them talk more about your company - your products and your services - than ever before. Use NimbleSchedule to get your employee’s increasingly complex schedules to them, and to signal the new social side to your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend establishing a communications policy, being sure your entire team knows it and follows it, and then monitoring carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can guarantee that at least some of your team will love having their schedule embedded in and around their concerts and parties and professional events they’re already using Facebook to learn about.

   <title>How to use the payroll export feature</title>
   <link href="/blog/payroll-export/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-05T06:02:45-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/payroll_export</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule’s web-based workforce management and employee scheduling software is completely integrated and operates on a centralized cloud-based platform. This means that all your business and employee data from your schedules are always available in real time. Your employees’ time cards can be taken directly from NimbleSchedule to your favorite payroll system for processing. With NimbleSchedule, you can export CSV formatted payroll data by opening  the Payroll report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, go to the ‘Reports’ tab and click on the ‘Payroll’ subheading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Payroll.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Payroll-1024x224.png&quot; alt=&quot;Payroll report&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, you can select a date range using the calendar selector on the report. For example, to select a start date, click on the first day of the date range and then select the end date. Once both dates are highlighted, you’re ready to go. Furthermore, you can filter the report by employee when you select one or more employees to include. In our attempt to be as adaptable as possible, we give you several options to group the report by employee or by date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re ready to run your report, you can click “Create Report” to generate the report on your screen or click the “Export to CSV” option to produce a file you can import into your payroll system.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On the Fly Shift Scheduling with Google Calendar</title>
   <link href="/blog/shift-scheduling-google-calendar/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-02T06:35:35-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/shift-scheduling-google-calendar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/iphone-google-calendar-071.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;google calendar shift scheduler&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-calendar-gets-nimble&quot;&gt;Google Calendar Gets Nimble!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NimbleSchedule - teamed up with your existing Google Calendar - gives you an almost unstoppable shift scheduling advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; These are just some of the ways that you can use the combination of Google Calendar and our Shift Scheduling package for the benefit of your business, your team and your entire operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar doesn’t cost anything&lt;/strong&gt;, and integrates your shift schedules into anything else you’re planning - special events, heavy work days or seasons, special schedules or anything else currently scribbled on your paper calendar that you or anyone on your staff needs to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;2. Set a weekly schedule and stick to it. **Even with unexpected changes, cancellations and additions to your schedule, you can maintain a public schedule, open and know to all your staff who never need to be surprised or caught off guard again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;3.** &lt;strong&gt;A Cloud Calendar Never Goes Missing.&lt;/strong&gt;  Make it as complicated as you need it to be. Everyone on your staff is kept informed of updates, changes and opportunities to Google Calendar, and to their shift schedule. You always have a back up and you can even review changes long after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How About  New Business?&lt;/strong&gt; If your sales staff is stressing, let them fight publicly over the best slots and the times with the most lucrative walk-ins. We hope you’ll keep it fair. But a public calendar also let’s you see who your best performers really are, and lets you analyze data over time so you can be sure you’re getting the most out of your staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5. Rearrange People and Dates and Meetings. **When everyone is on the same page, getting email updates and text notifications, your business can be as flexible s you are. You might even find that business is agile, and you respond better to opportunities as they present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Anywhere Access means More Remote Staff, Better Remote Services.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s really no end to the advantage of scheduling and notifying from anywhere anytime. Traveling and remote team members can do it all, and happier, while providing better service to all of your clients. &lt;strong&gt;Computers, tablets and iPhones and other smartphones are finally paying for themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Appearance is Everything. &lt;/strong&gt; There’s nothing like greeting new clients with a professional, well-organized and on-time team backing you up. NimbleSchedule lets you put your best team out there, where ever they’re going and it lets you keep them on time and fully satisfied, instead of wasting time on misunderstandings, over and under staffing situations, and all the other problems that can result from poor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Easy Automation!&lt;/strong&gt; Automate reminders, notifications, new schedule postings and events that allow you to maximize revenue and time on the job. At the same time, you’re giving your team a tool to make their own schedules and their own jobs more satisfying. Their own personal calendars are also optimized to keep personal and professional lives in harmony!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;No Risk Trial.&lt;/strong&gt; 14 days let’s you try the whole package out with your team, or just part of your team. Whether you’re using Google Calendar now or not, you’ll see that a few shifts will pass much easier and with everyone better informed and the results are always worth a full implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your NimbleSchedule rep today&lt;/strong&gt; about integrating NimbleSchedule’s one of a kind shift scheduling software with your current Google Calendar set up. We can advise you on a set up that’s headache free, rolls out in minutes and keeps your entire staff happy and working.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Your Overtime Just Got a Lot Smarter</title>
   <link href="/blog/overtime-scheduling-software/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-20T03:22:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/overtime-scheduling-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;schedule-smart-for-a-better-managed-crew-and-happier-customers&quot;&gt;Schedule Smart, for a Better Managed Crew and Happier Customers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/566060_99142722.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;online shift scheduler&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being truly successful in today’s broad service industries comes down to outstanding year-round Customer Service. Unfortunately, for many businesses, Customer Service demand can vary widely from month to month or season to season. Providing the service your customers demand can depend on having the right people in place at the right time. But keeping all of them in place, all the time, will quickly break your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overtime pay, if not planned for and budgeted for correctly gets exceedingly expensive. Though it probably only happens at certain times of the year, there are things you can do to minimize the cost and still meet the needs of both employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke with Andrea Altamirano, scheduling manager at a mid-size travel agency and timeshare scheduling agency. Most of her clientele want to travel in July and August, and November through Mid-February. Of course, they book all those trips anywhere from 2 to 4 months in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We go from a full time staff of about 35 people answering the phones, to really needing 70 people working anywhere from 10 – 14 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They don’t all do it every day, but we rely on people who can juggle knowledge of about 30 different, really important factors. Every call requires total expertise, and total commitment to the customer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsource the whole department?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We couldn’t do it and expect the same attention to quality, and the time we would spend training would never be able to catch up with the job we really need to be able to watch over. We’re watching over 35 full time and another 35 part-timers for a good six months out of every calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The heaviest season, between March and May can see payroll almost double.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But availability and longer hours of operation are balanced with a schedule that operators can check from anywhere. More of the management is done by the operators themselves and every operator is limited in the amount of overtime they can or need to work. Shift managers actually keep an eye, automatically, on part-timers’ availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More flexibility is built into the system each week, so that even though all employees are working more hours, they’re able to schedule when they’ll do them. They even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/blog/mobile-scheduling-survey/&quot;&gt;coordinate with the shift manager through the internet and through their own smartphones&lt;/a&gt; so that every shift is well covered, and every call is answered by a fresh voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We end up being the voice for the whole company, so as frustrating and hectic as it gets, we have to be on point when the phone rings, even 10 hours into a shift.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule allows Andrea to shine in the eyes of the company while basically outsourcing the tough part of scheduling, and still retaining employees who get more control, and more responsibility. All of that used to be Andrea’s headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s just another NimbleSchedule.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Working with schedule templates</title>
   <link href="/blog/schedule-templates/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-03T05:43:43-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/schedule_templates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can use a schedule template to organize your scheduling requirements in advance of the actual schedule. Building a weekly work schedule template will make scheduling fast and simple!
If you have a schedule that is fairly consistent from week to week, you can save this schedule as a template and simply re-use this template to create new schedules faster.
You can create as many templates as you wish. For example, you might create a templates called “Weekly Schedule” and use this from week to week or a template called “Holiday Schedule” with special scheduling needs for the holiday. To create a new template,  select the “Save as Template” button on the schedule page and give it a name. Note that you can save the template with the currently assigned employees or just the shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To edit existing templates, **Navigate to the Schedules **tab to view the list of templates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template_list1-1024x212.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template_list1-1024x212.png&quot; alt=&quot;Schedule template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the schedule you want to edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;just like the your regular schedules, each shift can be assigned directly to an employee, or left as an open shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply this template to a new schedule, select the “Apply Template” button, specify the day you want to start the schedule and the template will be applied from this date. If you saved the template with employees, these employees will be placed on the schedule. If not, open shifts will be created for you and you can then assign employees to these shifts later&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Departmental and Job Title Scheduling Saves the Party</title>
   <link href="/blog/departmental-job-shift-scheduling/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-20T11:55:18-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/departmental-job-shift-scheduling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;plenty-of-businesses-would-go-go-up-in-flames-without-advanced-scheduling-by-department-and-job-title&quot;&gt;Plenty of Businesses would go Go Up In Flames without Advanced Scheduling by Department and Job Title!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/scheduling-software-departmental.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Job position scheduling&quot; /&gt;Maria Aceves is the Human Resources chief – and default scheduling manager - for a mid-size corporate catering firm in Daly City, California. The firm pays the bills with a stable of steady clients, providing box and buffet lunches, Monday through Friday. It’s a first rate food preparation, delivery and drop off service, with set up and linens and only the occasional interruption.
Icing on the cake though, and a nightmare for Maria, is the company’s thriving dinner, special events and banquet service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday through Friday. Maria is scheduling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2-3 chefs&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2-3 cooks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 prep cooks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a kitchen crew of 5 people&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;plus 2 cleaning people&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 drivers,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and 2 phone receptionists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day to day, 9 to 5, and 6Am to 2PM schedules are the norm. But from there, things start to get more complicated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some of these people will stay on and work special events, when time allows, or when they need the money, or when the company is stretched and we really need the people. It happens all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Though parties for up 200 people are welcome, they’re usually planned for months in advance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every special event will see personnel requirements double, triple or even quadruple. “Weekends and evenings are your call, but every day there is one. We’ll have up to four or five events, sometimes, on Thursdays and Fridays.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relatively big, unexpected business lunch, mid-week, pays everyone a premium, but used to put an incredible strain on Maria. Getting the right workers, and keeping them informed, and coming back for more, used to require dozens of phone calls, maybe 3 hours in the middle of the day and a serious headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, Maria is using NimbleSchedule, and coordinating everything with the party people.&lt;/strong&gt; The fact is, the Party People, drive Maria crazy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the task of scheduling and bringing in this whole variety of workers has gotten a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;define-departments-and-job-positions-and-fire-away&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Departments and Job Positions and Fire Away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every event requiring different departments and positions, and the numbers and faces changing constantly, doing it all would be impossible without on-the-fly, coordinated online scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria consults with the number of guests needed for each event and checks any special requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; She then punches the information into NimbleSchedule’s calendaring interface. Appropriate workers from every department and for every necessary position are notified automatically. They confirm whether or not they will attend and get information on time and hours for each shift. It all happens via email and smartphone, and business is booming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“NimbleSchedule has allowed us to really professionalize the level of skills and presentation that we have representing us, and the system is easier and faster than anything else I’ve dealt with. It’s also made my life and my job a lot easier to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;as-far-as-i-know-all-the-people-on-my-staff-like-the-nimbleschedule-system-as-much-as-i-do&quot;&gt;“As far as I know, all the people on my staff like the NimbleSchedule system as much as I do.”&lt;/h3&gt;

   <title>Employee Time Clocking and the New Workforce!</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-time-clock-app/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-16T13:49:03-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-time-clock-app</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nimble-schedule-time-clocking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;remote internet based employee time clock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;companies-change-so-does-your-workforce-and-your-workforce-requirements&quot;&gt;Companies change. So does your workforce and your workforce requirements.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses that used to rely on a staff of 30 or 40 full-time in-house employees today do better with remote and telecommuting staff. Often they grow to twice their former size, but the basic relationship with staff is vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance based and judged by every job well done, today’s employees also depend on the freedom to come and go, to work at their own pace and to be judge solely by the work they can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No matter how your business is modeled, your employees will thank you for allowing them greater freedom and flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt; Clocking in on the shop floor used to require a physical presence, but today, your employees, no matter if they’re engineers or call-center representatives, can clock on and off based on the needs of the business, not the location of the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shift supervisors and managers are not chained to traditional clocking in and out, but, with NimbleSchedule, can enjoy a fully scalable system to grow with the company and employees on and off site. And you can schedule more, better workers for remote or distance locations, keep better track of their hours and retain full control over schedules, time-shifts and staffing allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitive information is kept secure on a central database and it’s accessible whenever and where ever you need it, and reporting is advanced, accurate and always in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-internet-based-employee-time-clock-that-keeps-your-best-workers-and-keeps-them-happy&quot;&gt;The Internet Based Employee Time Clock That Keeps Your Best Workers, and Keeps Them Happy!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business owners, working with NimbleSchedule actually find that with the flexibility and freedom they can offer, they’re able to keep better workers working, and let the less efficient one go. In some cases, you’re saving money just by optimizing your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With full, flexible payroll software integration,  painless set-up, and access from everywhere, there’s really no better employee time clock solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow more and better workers to clock in and off with NimbleSchedule’s efficient anywhere, &lt;strong&gt;online employee time clock&lt;/strong&gt;, and who knows where your company can go. With all the other time and money saving features, you might just find you have enough to time to rethink your entire business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If providing a time clock was an extra expense, imagine what you’ll save on central servers, work stations and office overhead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule allows today’s business to clock on and off, and you get the very best scheduling software on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mobile Time Sheets have Never Been Easier!</title>
   <link href="/blog/mobile-time-sheets-have-never-been-easier/"/>

   <id>/blog/mobile-time-sheets-have-never-been-easier</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punching the time clock used to require that hourly employees show up and punch in from a regular mechanical clock actually mounted to your wall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of course was punched cards, time-sheet coordination and ultimately, lots more paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule’s automated times, and remote clocking in and out process has eliminated all of the need for physical check-ins and outs, and we’ve made the whole process &lt;strong&gt;a lot more efficient&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/05.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Online Shift Scheduler&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    Online Time Sheets Have never been easier to manage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NimbleSchedule, employees can simply click on “My Timesheet” and clock in. When the shift is over, they can do the same thing, from the internet or from a smart phone. You can even set up far more flexible schedules that allow employees to clock in only when they’re working and only when it’s convenient for employees and the company!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;online time clock&quot; /&gt;
    To clock in, simply click here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all whether the employee is on site, or working at a remote location. And clocking out, you always get a summary of the time you’ve put in, or that your team member put in, and the entire shift is summarized on the Time Sheets page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shift Software&quot; /&gt;
    Clock Out and get an instant summary of the shift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, manually approving online time-sheets doesn’t have to take up all of your time. Bulk time-sheet approval is easy because you establish the rules up front and the system will reject requests that don’t meet your standards. You still get happier team members because they don’t need to waste time traveling any more than you need to waste time scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your payroll people get much less paper and can even select what they want or need to print out, from simple time reports to more complex analytics for review or analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how many employees your in charge of, and no matter how many locations, NimbleSchedule lets you approve and process multiple schedules and time sheets for entire teams or for individual workers as easily as sending an email. Employees and staff are notified when changes are made, approved or rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling and Communications</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-and-internet-communications/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-02T14:18:07-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-and-internet-communications</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the Internet Age, just about everyone believes they already know the secrets to effective, useful and efficient communications. It’s a wonder then that so many businesses, large and small and everything in between, are still plagued by miscommunication, communication breakdowns and simple failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our business that can simply mean employee absences. Excused, in-excused or inexplicable, absences often come down to simple communication failures and those very often concern the where, when and what-time exactly of any job posting. 
Schedules that can involve dozens or even hundreds of employees are often the least understood and the schedules that involve the smallest number of people who really need to be involved in their own creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s always been the case, particularly when a work schedule is drawn up on a single sheet of paper, perhaps copied and posted physically in the hopes that every employee will verify and accept it. That was the top down world of employee scheduling. 
Disgruntled or unhappy workers, even when they’re the otherwise best on the team, are told “tough luck” and the schedule stands until it sometimes painfully or pain-stakingly done all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it may be still impossible to keep everyone “happy” all the time. But prioritizing employee communications before, during and after the scheduling process makes a lot more of them a lot more “happy” than ever before in the past. If you’re in a competitive industry having trouble holding onto your best employees, or your spending too much time on scheduling, it should make you happy too. 
Simple effective staff communication today requires a robust tool and an internet connection. It really is that simple. And managers are constantly surprised by how effective instant messaging by email or text SMS can be, especially when it is two way communication. 
There’s simply no question that employee input and interaction radically increases employee morale and the level of respect they feel for an employer. And the number of excuses for misunderstandings, missed shifts or absences has been known to drop dramatically. 
It really is as easy as deploying an internet based solution that automates communications and calendar schedules so that employees get a front row seat in the decision making process and scheduling managers simply institute some basic rules. Rules can be as complicated or as simple as they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting minimum or maximum hours are simple ones, but difficult special events or heavy demand hours can be covered and scheduled while under or overstaffing situations are easily avoided. Conflict free schedules can be easily established, reviewed and approved by every employee or just by a shift manager. In every case, miscommunication is minimized and everyone who needs to know gets a notification by email, by SMS text, or by both.&lt;br /&gt;
If you haven’t considered a simple scheduling tool to improve your own employee communications plan then consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/features/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt;. There is simply no more Nimble Scheduler on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Flexible scheduling has really come of age with internet based scheduling and open shift software. Here’s how a more flexible schedule can benefit your employees and your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;employee-retention-and-flexible-scheduling&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Retention and Flexible Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Scheduling Software Has Revolutionized the Company –Employee Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accommodating the needs of mobile, highly specialized and high quality workers is more difficult than ever. Employee turnover is expensive, inefficient and, for some companies, totally out of hand. Unhappy employees cost almost any company far more than owners or stockholders would prefer. Yet flexible scheduling, which has proven one of the single most effective employee retention policies has only caught on in limited sectors of the over-all economy. Namely in technically advanced industries that have traditionally relied on more mobile and remote workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, one of the reasons companies have stuck with the old-school, hard scheduling is simply because it was easier. Week after week of 20 or 40 hours for everyone, and time off and vacations only when applied for a week in advance is just how it was done on paper. And that’s how it stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing employees and local managers greater control over the work place used to require dozens of phone calls and hundreds of hours per year just in scheduling and shift-planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as more and more employees find better opportunities to meet their own needs and still earn a living, the onus is on more employers to hold on to the employees they’ve got by offering more forgiving schedules, and more opportunities to do the work that needs to be done, irrespective of when, if not always of where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages to flexibly scheduling employees and allowing employees more control over their schedules and over the time they spend on the job can be dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Far better balance between work and family issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More options, about when to work, what hours and what schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased loyalty, commitment and productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longer term commitments and lower turn-over&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher morale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More and better home-based or otherwise remote employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced overall labor costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is, with more and better managed seasonal and part time employees, many businesses are even able to significantly reduce salary and wage costs while still maintaining high quality, satisfied and enthusiastic employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-revolution-in-flexible-employee-scheduling&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Real Revolution in Flexible Employee Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexible scheduling depends simply on up-to-date internet based calendar and messaging systems that put every employee on the same calendar page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system allows for on-the-fly schedule changes, replacements and updates as easily as changing a calendar program. Automated messaging, consent and confirmation systems mean that every shift can be covered and very few excuses for being un-informed remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an open scheduled retail shop might rely on more part time store workers picking up 4 hour shifts convenient to their own schedules. The total number they can schedule is limited by a master schedule, controlled by the manager, but every shift is voluntary and over staffing becomes virtually impossible. The manager simply limits the number of shifts that each employee can volunteer for. When ever the schedule is changed or altered, every employee gets an email or text notification and the entire staff is happier, having selected, swapped and traded shifts until the schedule is finalized or until each shift begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that just depends on the manager’s preference and the needs of the company. It’s really that easy and we’ve seen expensive staff turn-over nearly eliminated from some companies.  We’ll be writing more detailed case studies in the future of companies using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/features/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’d like to add your own story, simply leave a comment in the section below.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule Feature Enhancements</title>
   <link href="/blog/whats-new-nimbleschedule/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-06T11:49:15-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/whats-new-nimbleschedule</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Drag &amp;amp; Drop Shifts Across Employees&lt;/strong&gt;
We have an exciting update. In an effort to make scheduling as easy as possible we have added drag and drop capabilities to the schedule view. While on a “day” view for a schedule, in order assign a shift to another employee you can simply pick up the shift and drag it to another employee. Note that in order for the employee to accept the shit, they have to be in the same position&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Add Labels to Shifts&lt;/strong&gt;
Another requested feature we recently added is the ability to add label to shifts. When creating and editing shifts, you can now add a label or title such as “AM” or “PM” to the shift which would then show up on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Multi-Location Support&lt;/strong&gt;
We recently re-worked the schedule view to now indicate the location in the schedule to make it easier for employees who work in multiple location to see all their shifts on one page with the location clearly marked.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Employee Scheduling Software Can Help</title>
   <link href="/blog/how-an-employee-scheduling-software-can-help/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-18T08:13:31-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/how-an-employee-scheduling-software-can-help</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’re managing a company where everybody clocks in at 8 and leaves at 5, you should have little cause for worry where scheduling employees is concerned. Since everyone works the same hours, staffing levels can be easily monitored, and it’s highly unlikely that a staff member would be a no-show because he or she forgot about or wasn’t aware of the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most staffing managers and shift supervisors of multi-shift, multiple-location businesses however, employee scheduling can be a nightmare. Yup, you read that right - a nightmare. Why? Because you not only have to consider the needs of the business (how many people are needed when, and what skills and skill level should they possess) and how these needs impact on profitability. You also have to deal with issues that concern the employees themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 6 of the most common the scheduling issues a manager has to contend with where employee scheduling software may come in handy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Unusual Shift Rotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some businesses operate at odd hours and there are also those that are running round the clock. Making sure that shifts are properly manned takes a lot of effort because work hours per employee may change from day to day. Any misstep in the scheduling and you can be left with a shift that has too many or too few workers. Without employee scheduling software that automates the entire process, scheduling would be a taxing and time consuming task, and even then, the final product could be fraught with errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Last Minute Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the most well-planned and organized employee schedule can be thrown into shambles if there are unexpected absences that crop up. But people falling ill or running into emergencies are a reality and hence, should be dealt with in the best manner possible. First and foremost, a replacement has to be found. Then, you also need be certain that the person picking up the shift isn’t already doing overtime and/or isn’t scheduled for work himself right before or after the “extra” duty hours. Staff scheduling software can be trusted to take care of these details based on employee data and availability, and with some input from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Employee Turnover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens. Just when you’ve already gotten a workable schedule in place, one of your employees ups and quits, bringing you back to the drawing board with your scheduling efforts. Such a situation is not uncommon in many fast-paced businesses. The larger the workforce, the higher the turnover rate. This makes it virtually impossible to manually schedule employees without the right organizational tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Split Schedules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A split schedule is one where the employee doesn’t fulfill his 8 hours of work in one sitting. For instance, he may be required to do the first half of his shift from 8 am to 12 noon, and then do the rest from 6 to 10 pm. As with uncommon shift rotations, split schedules can be a pain to organize because there are more details to consider and because the employees themselves may not be amenable to such arrangement. It’s difficult to plan activities when they work such hours and they would need to commute more. However, with the aid of an employee scheduling software, it’s easier to keep track of split schedules. Further, you can also ensure that such shifts are fairly distributed among the employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**5. Varying Employee Rates 
**
The labor cost per shift is a crucial factor that needs to be included in the planning of staff schedules. Some personnel may have higher rates than others due to experience and ranking, and there are also staff supervisors to include in the calculations. An automated employee scheduler does the costing for you - promptly and accurately at that - so you can make the necessary adjustments and keep expenses within budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**6. Seniority  **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most organizations don’t have an official policy regarding seniority, staff members who have been around the longest, often feel some entitlement to getting the most ideal work hours. If the scheduling were done manually, it would be difficult to say no to the more senior employees every time they request for certain shifts. But by using a work scheduling tool, you can better balance the “rights” of your senior staff while also giving heed to the needs of the newer employees of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streamlining your organization’s workforce does not have to be overly burdensome. Just find the right employee scheduling software for your business and you’ll be well on your way to an stress-free, problem-free staff scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Employee Scheduling Software: What Benefits Does It Offer?</title>
   <link href="/blog/employee-scheduling-software-what-benefits-does-it-offer/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-18T08:10:11-08:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/employee-scheduling-software-what-benefits-does-it-offer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While many business owners have heard about employee scheduling software and its many uses, not all have delved down to what it really translates to in terms of benefits for the company. Time and cost savings are two of the most obvious advantages but there are even more. Let’s find out just how automatic scheduling can improve efficiency all around, eliminating scheduling headaches and increasing your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;●Saves time and money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant savings that can be had with a scheduling software is time, and as they all say - time is gold. It is not uncommon to find shift managers spending hours dealing with excel spreadsheets, or worse, even manually plotting charts and tables just to properly match employees, work schedules, and tasks. If the process were automated though, a job that previously took an hour or two to complete, can now be done in mere minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the hundreds of hours that can be saved annually and the corresponding increase in productivity and savings in financial resources. Labor costs are also within control because no one can log in hours exceeding his allocation for the week unless duly approved by management. For an astute businessman, these benefits alone would be enough reason to invest in an employee scheduling software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;●Prevents loss of opportunity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poorly organized employee scheduling can also bring about loss of opportunity. In any fast-growing business, every person counts. Being under-staffed could result to inferior product quality, poor customer service, or orders being turned down. With online work scheduling software, you are guaranteed that no shifts or locations are left undermanned because you always have access who works when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case a worker begs for some time off due to illness of personal concerns, it’s easy to find a replacement because you can immediately check who is available to serve as alternate. Further, with most scheduling programs, SMS alerts or email notifications can be sent to the substitute employees so they will be informed straight away of the additional work or change in schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;●Helps you find the right person for the job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to manually browse through the files of various employee just to find the suitable person for a particular job can be frustrating, not to mention time-consuming. Employee scheduling software can also help with this because it’s not only a computerized scheduler, it can also serve as a quick database for your employees. With just a few clicks, you will be able to access information on staff members including contact data, skills and the corresponding level of these skills, and previous work experience. This should give you a good gauge of the capability of a person to perform a specific task or added duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;●Allows a more hands-on management.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything may be automated; but it doesn’t mean that you pay less attention to the goings-on around you. On the contrary, work scheduling software has made it very convenient to monitor employee availability or non-availability, ensure that all shifts and all locations are adequately staffed, and keep track of payroll costs.
Relevant statistics, graphs, and tables may even be generated by the software for higher management appraisal, and to further assist you in tracking scheduling trends and minimizing labor expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;●Provides employee convenience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, employees may need to take some time off for various reasons, and such absence may cause disruption in the business. Utilizing staff scheduling software however ensures that operations continue to run smoothly despite the no-show of some personnel. Equally important, employees don’t have to jump through hoops to get some hours or days free, even if such leave is unexpected. A much-needed visit to the dentist for instance, will not have to be indefinitely postponed, and a sick family member can be given priority without having to worry about what’s happening at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the concerned employees can simply swap shifts with others who are available on those days. Or, the shift manager can leave such days as “open” for others to “pick up” for some extra work. These changes can all be made via the scheduling software.
Whether you have 50 or 500 employees, employee scheduling software can make organizing your schedules simple and fuss-free. If you want to realize savings in time and payroll costs, promote productivity, and maximize your employees’ skill and availability, then it’s high time you give it a try. &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.nimbleschedule.com/account/create&quot;&gt;Sign up for a free trial today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tips on Employee Management for Better Profitability</title>
   <link href="/blog/tips-on-employee-management-for-better-profitability/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-01T18:04:19-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/tips-on-employee-management-for-better-profitability</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that uncontrolled labor costs can cause a business to stop operations altogether. Pay no heed to how employees are using their work time and you could find yourself or your company aboard the express train en route to “ClosedShopsville.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the keys to having a cost-efficient workforce is of course, to use an employee scheduling software. However, if you can’t use one right away, there are still a number of ways where you can effectively supervise your staff and pinpoint the areas where you can make improvements in managing people and in keeping within payroll budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to take a step back and evaluate the way you and your employees are doing things. Could there be a better way of planning the schedule? Or are there perhaps better procedures than the one you’re currently using that could help employees get tasks done faster and then move on to the next? Check out these employee management tips and see how you can apply them in your own organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check time sheets from time to time and see if they really coincide with the employee’s actual arrival and off time. After all, it never hurts for your staff to know that the boss is watching. For employees, there are so many ways of riding the clock, and an hour’s worth of work shaved off by even just a couple of employees can amount to precious labor dollars in actual expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a regular review of your payroll costs. If it’s not peak season for instance and there’s a significant (or even a not-so-significant) rise in labor expense look into that immediately. In addition, review the pay rates of your staff members of varying levels. While you can never lower the rates that have been given to them already, you can at least ensure that employee scheduling has been properly done, with the higher-paid employees evenly spread out among the various shifts. This way you can maximize the leadership and learning potential of both the senior staff and the beginners respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect sufficient data and determine your employee to sales and employee to customer ratio. If you have too many employees and not enough sales or customers, then you’re spending on labor unnecessarily. Conversely, if you don’t have enough workers for a high time or season, you may be saving on payroll but lagging on the customer service end. Make sure all the factors balance out properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to incorporate technology into your system, make sure you do so wisely. One such effective tool to ensure that employees are getting to work at the times when they are supposed to is a biometric clocking system. It requires the worker to have his finger or entire hand scanned as proof his presence. But while this type of equipment is effective for simple clock in and out purposes, it is not a very wise idea to use them for inserting PINs into a Point of Sale System particularly if you are running a business where workers may have greasy or dirty hands at any point. This can easily damage your equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure that only one supervisor or manager is taking charge of approving leaves and time-offs at any given time. This will prevent overlapping of approved time-off and leave requests. You will be able to properly accommodate employee’s requests, without your business suffering from having insufficient personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above tips can go a long way in helping you achieve efficiency in managing your people, you will have an easier time if you have an automated staff scheduling service do all the work for you. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll be assured of efficient schedules, managed costs, and a lot of extra time to focus on other important matters. We offer a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/plans&quot;&gt;14-day free trial&lt;/a&gt; so you really have nothing to lose with giving NimbleSchedule a try.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Millennial Workforce: A New Breed of Workers</title>
   <link href="/blog/the-millennial-workforce-a-new-breed-of-workers/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-23T18:10:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/the-millennial-workforce-a-new-breed-of-workers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s workers are a mix of the different generations of the times, with each group bringing with them the distinct attitudes, unique experiences, and the collective influences that define their respective generations. On the top tier are the Baby Boomers (1946-1964) who are certified workaholics but are now pushing 60, while next in line are the pragmatic yet risk-taking members of Generation X (1965-1980). A relatively unknown quantity is the Millennials who are just starting to join the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the Millennials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born between the years 1980 and 2000 (or thereabouts), a lot has been said about the Generation Y. The Millennialss, as they are also called, are said to be products of doting parents who think they are special simply because they exist, individuals who will only take “yes” for an answer, and an incredibly self-reliant group who would rather Google the solutions to tech concerns than call IT for support. Millennials also have a simplified approach to setting priorities: they come first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, a lot of the preconceived notions about this generation that has been rehashed over the past few years aren’t exactly positive. But on the other hand, the Generation Y’ers also bring with them their own set of desirable work traits that will no doubt prove to be useful as they start climbing up the corporate ladder. Because they were brought up believing that any goal is within their reach, they have adopted a “can-do” attitude. Further, Millennials are known for being tech-savvy and experts at multi-tasking. They also work well in teams within a structured and creative work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Millennials at Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as to how any of these said characteristics will manifest themselves as they slowly assimilate into the workforce still remains to be seen. One fact remains, though: with over 76 million individuals born during the years 1981 to 1999, it will only be a matter of time before the Millennials take over the workplace as the baby boomers take their leave. In fact, by 2014, there will be more Millennials driving than there are baby boomers alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many managers and companies, this new breed of workers are more than welcome. After all, who wouldn’t want confident and goal-oriented individuals on their team? Give this worker a variety of tasks and you can be sure that he’ll get these accomplished and then some. But then again, you also have to be prepared for their high expectations as to how an ideal work environment should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, a Gen Y employee thrives on diversity and challenge. Give them the same routine day in and day out, and pretty soon, they will experience boredom and feel that their skills are not being maximized. While Millennials understand that they have to “pay their dues” and start with entry-level jobs, they do so with the intent of accomplishing valuable and meaningful work so as to move on to greater responsibilities. Feedback therefore, has to be constant and immediate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new breed of American workers also prefer a healthy balance between professional responsibilities and personal obligations. While this is nothing new to most people in the working class, this is a particular concern for the Y Generation. A recent survey conducted shows that 73% of employed Millennials believe that working time should be no more than the time they spend with their families and friends, and pursuing personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Gen Y Employees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do companies need to do to keep these new breed of workers happy? Simple - give them what they want. Or at least, what they need for them to realize their full potential. These include a proper work structure with clearly defined assignments and corresponding success factors, challenging tasks that leave no room for boredom, group projects, as Millennials perform better and accomplish more in teams, feedback when they ask for it (or even if they don’t), and a balanced life-work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Millennials want flexible work arrangements for them to be able to find that right balance between career and personal pursuits. This requires some reinventing of the conventional work schedules that most businesses are using. The good news is Gen Y employees are also social media geniuses and are highly adept at all types of electronic and communication devices out there today. This means that they can easily deal with any non-traditional means of work scheduling that businesses may adopt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Employee Scheduling Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the aid of an efficient employee scheduling software like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt;, you can make the most of your Millennial employee’s flexibility and electronic literacy. For one, it helps you manage part-time employees who are juggling work and school, and allow you to easily swap shifts if you need to accommodate worker requests. Employees are also welcome to do self-service scheduling for as long as they don’t violate any of the rules previously set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the work schedules are finalized and approved, notices are immediately sent out to the concerned employees via SMS or email. For Millennials who are always connected, these methods of communication work out perfectly, so they don’t miss out on important events both in the workplace and outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any organization looking to get and keep Millennials in their ranks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;NimbleSchedule&lt;/a&gt; is a must-have tool that will help you provide them with the flexible and balanced work environment that is best for this generation of workers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NimbleSchedule now supports shift swaps</title>
   <link href="/blog/announcing-shift-swaps/"/>
   <updated>2011-09-29T18:10:26-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/announcing-shift-swaps</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NimbleSchedule now allows employees to pick up open shifts and swap shifts amongst themselves. All this is done through a very intuitive interface and allows managers to approve or deny the request with one click!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To swap shifts, simply select the “Trade this shift” option on the shift and off you go. You will be presented with a selection of appropriate shifts based on your position and once you select a shift to swap, the receiving employee will be immediately notified of your request to swap shifts. Once they approve, the swap will then take place and the manager can approve or deny the swap if he or she chooses to do so.
&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Capture.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pick up an open shift, simply select “view open shifts” from your schedule. You will then be presented with a list of available open shifts to pick up. After the request to pick up the shift is approved by your manager, it will then show up on your schedule!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Here’s How Employee Scheduling Can Be Made Easy</title>
   <link href="/blog/heres-how-employee-scheduling-can-be-made-easy/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-27T18:11:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>/blog/heres-how-employee-scheduling-can-be-made-easy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it - a manager’s task is never an easy one. And if you add to that the complexities of employee scheduling, you’ll find yourself faced with a myriad of issues that can cause undue stress and not too few headaches. This is because there are many things to take into consideration when organizing your workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost are the needs of the business. How many people do you need and what are the capabilities expected of these workers? If you are running an operation that requires more people on certain hours or days, and less on others, staff scheduling must be properly worked out so that no shift is over- or under-manned. The same goes for businesses that cover multiple locations where scheduling is centralized in the main office. Can employees of one branch cover for employees in another? And what about shift or location supervisors? These details are crucial in being able to come up with a staffing schedule that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said though, keep in mind that payroll expenses have to be factored in as well. After all, the cost of labor has a huge impact on the business’ bottom line. Pay rate per employee, the necessity of adding more people, and overtime expenses if any, should be carefully considered. You want to have costs remain within the budget, keeping the number of employees to a minimum would be the prudent thing to do. But then again, you also don’t want to compromise service to customers by having too few workers at any given time. Such a situation can be a tough balancing act for any manager. What makes it even more difficult is if you would have to do the job costing analysis manually or even with the use of spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then of course, there’s also the employees’ satisfaction and morale to take into account. The last thing you would want on your hands is a bunch of disgruntled workers who are either overburdened with too many hours, or are not earning much because there aren’t enough work hours to allocate. In addition, requests for emergency, sick, or vacation time are work scheduling issues that have to be addressed, sometimes, right there and then. If a worker were to fall ill suddenly, you may have to find a replacement immediately depending on the type of business you are running or on the job of that employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts in vacation requests are another matter altogether. For a restaurant business for instance, Friday and Saturday nights are among the busiest, yet it’s not unheard of for two or more employees asking for these days off due to family affairs or other personal concerns. Hotel chains experience the same thing during holidays. So if at all you can afford to grant requests for vacation during these times, to whom do you give that privilege? In some companies, the first-come-first-served policy is applied, while in others, seniority matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in whatever way you deal with emergency or conflicting time-off, the bottom line is, being in these situations is no fun at all. While you would want to grant all requests, in reality, there is no way you can please everyone. Some may be accommodated now, and others at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s also clear is that juggling all these aspects of employee scheduling can sap a business owner or manager’s time and energy. You would need to have not only the skill to properly match the business needs with the right employees and at the right time, you also have to have patience to handle employees’ individual concerns. The stress and pressure of producing an accurate and well-prepared employee schedule could lead you to become overworked, and other equally vital chores could be left undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing this seemingly insurmountable task is not without a simple solution - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;employee scheduling software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; With this tool, staff scheduling is easy and automated. As soon as all pertinent details such as employee information and availability, shifts, locations, and others are entered into the program, everything can be matched and scheduled accordingly with just a few clicks and within a matter of minutes. Some programs can even furnish you with reports on payroll expenses, employee performance, and trends in customer traffic. Sure, you will have to shell out a few dollars every month for a good employee scheduling software, but for the time savings and efficiency it brings in return, it’s well worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reasons To Use Employee Scheduling Software</title>
   <link href="/blog/reasons-to-use-employee-scheduling-software/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the keys to a successful business enterprise is employee efficiency. And it all starts with organized and systematic employee scheduling. This is a crucial aspect of any business venture but, unfortunately, one that many entrepreneurs have either failed to recognize or done little about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some opt to use spreadsheets for this task, and up to a certain point, these can be useful in getting the basics of the job done. In the long run, though, nothing beats good employee scheduling software in providing a way to organize your workers’ schedules quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Here are the top 5 reasons why every business should make use of scheduling software for its employees.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Shift Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a manual scheduling process, the shift manager has to spend precious time going through a number of steps just to ensure that there are workers when and where needed. Determining the number of shifts in a given period, establishing how many people are needed per shift, getting the employees’ availability, and finally, matching all this data to come up with the final schedule are only a few of the necessary tasks that the manager or business owner has to undertake. Needless to say, such a process is tedious and prone to errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of employee scheduling software, however, all these processes are automated - from the shift details to the allocation of hours to each employee. Even factors like employee type and pay rate are incorporated into the program so that you have a complete overview of how the employees are scheduled for a certain period, without having to go through a series of time-consuming tasks.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Track of Hours Worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks of manual scheduling is that it is difficult to monitor just how many hours every given employee has worked. Some may have logged in too many hours, and others too few. Worse, a number of workers may be rendering unnecessary overtime without your knowledge. This could put your actual operational costs seriously out of sync with your set budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that such a scenario isn’t likely to happen if scheduling software is in place. Most programs send prompt notification to the administrator if any employee is trying to log in more hours or has exceeded his allocation. And because the system also records all pertinent information regarding the schedule and the service rendered per employee, no one can dispute the accuracy of the actual hours he or she has worked per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenient for Staff Requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling software also comes in handy when employees change their working days or availability from time to time. With most scheduling programs, an interface is also provided for employees to put in their requests for working (or not working) on particular days or reducing their number of hours temporarily for a day or two. Even if many employees were to do this in a given week, the software can effortlessly and automatically adjust the schedule, saving the shift manager from a major headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible Anytime, Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common feature of online employee scheduling software is that it is web-based, and therefore accessible from any internet-enabled device. This allows users to simply log in through their home computers to monitor the shifts (for managers), or to get their respective schedules (for employees). Web-based software also makes it easy for administrators to disseminate to employees any changes or updates in the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Monitoring of Next Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any shift manager would know that an organized shift can be thrown into disarray if even one employee fails to turn up for work. While personal emergencies are factors that are beyond the company’s control, what is frustrating is when the worker simply “forgets” his schedule. With online scheduling software, however, the chances of an employee forgetting are drastically reduced because he can easily check when he will be working next. Some scheduling systems even take it a step further and automatically send an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nimbleschedule.com/nimblenews/product-news/tips-tricks/employee-shift-reminders/&quot;&gt;email reminder&lt;/a&gt; to the employee a few hours before his scheduled shift begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, employee scheduling software is a valuable tool for any business that wants to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and free up valuable time - time that can be used instead on growing the business.&lt;/p&gt;
